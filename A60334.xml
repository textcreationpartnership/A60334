            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note n="*" place="bottom">I.

               <pb facs="tcp:53284:3"/>his Holy word, to reſiſt the inſulting, and detect the fraud of ſubtil and violent adverſaries of the true Catholic Faith, appearing under the veil of defenders of it; and endeavor to ſhew with unfaigned, plain and ſolid proofs, that the Faith we profeſs in the reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> (in which many other Illuſtrious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions join with us) is the true primitive Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Apoſtolic faith, which our Savior Jeſus, and his ſacred Apoſtles taught and eſtabliſhed on earth; that our adverſaries, branding us with Hereſy and Schiſm, are themſelves the prime cauſe of all the ſchiſms and confuſions, which too long have vexed Chriſtianity; and are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of as many Hereſies, as Articles coined by them in after ages, which I hope we ſhall prove to be oppoſit both to Canonical Scripture, and to the Doctrin and practice of the Primitive Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic and Apoſtolic Church. In which oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion certainly the true nature of Hereſy doth conſiſt; however they to their own advantage, would make men believe, that the Popes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and decrees, muſt be the rule of all, and nothing Hereſy, but what is oppoſit to them.</p>
            <p>His pretended Infallibility, Supremacy, Vice-Godſhip, and ſuch like big ſounding Titles, (but emty, as here will appear) have frighted
<pb facs="tcp:53284:4"/>a great part of men to becom ſlaves unto him. The invention of Purgatory, indulgences, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and other engines of lucre, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his means to maintain his uſurped power. My work will be to ſhew with plaineſs of reaſons, ſuitable to the ſincerity of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and appoſit to overthrow their ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, that the forementioned tenets of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh faction, fewel of all the Combuſtions of Chriſtendom, are not from above conveied by the Holy Ghoſt, but conceived in the mints of earthly paſſions: <hi>for the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and without Hypocriſy.</hi> Jam. <hi>3.17.</hi> Such is not the wiſdom taught by the Roman Court, or Church, (if they will have it ſo called.) It is not pure, but corrupted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pernicious errors as will appear in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. It is not peaceable, but contentious; not eaſy to be intreated, but obſtinat againſt all reaſonable overtures of peace, againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and ardent deſire of all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for a Council truly Occumenical and free, wherein the Roman Biſhop and faction, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, may ſit with like freedom and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency

               </gap>ord of God, and rules of Chriſtian ſincerity, as practiſed in thoſe purer ages of primitive Chriſtianity. Nothing will ſatisfy them, but a blind obedience, and entire ſubmiſſion to their will. Far are they from being full of Mercy: their thoughts are not of peace, but of death and deſtruction to all their fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that will not be of their party.</p>
            <p>All this I ſhall endeavor to demonſtrate by a cloſe and ſerious Examen of the particulars conducing to the diſcovery thereof, with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign then the Glory of God, with no prejudice or Paſſion againſt the Roman Church, but with a hearty deſire of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; that ſetting aſide all profane policy, it may return to that primitive purity and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre it had, when <hi>the Faith of it was praiſed throughout the whole World, Rom. 1.8.</hi> and ſo join heart and hands with other Chriſtians to the Edification, and thereby to to the Converſion of Infidels, and to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſplendor of Chriſtianity.

            <p>Theſe conſiderations made me deſire earneſtly to ſpend the remnant of my days, retired and unknown, to prepare the better for the long day of Eternity which I reſolved when firſt I entertained a thought of relinquishing the errors of my former Profeſſion, and ſticking to the Evangelical Doctrin of the reformed Church. But it ſeems that Soveraign Providence vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant over all, was pleaſed to diſpoſe otherwiſe of me. For being actually ordering my concerns for a voiage to the end aforeſaid, it pleaſed God that a paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the reaſons of my diſſatisfaction with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, by way of ſoliloquie with God, (that by further Praier and conſideration, I might be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of his Holy will,) dropped from me, and fell into the hands of ſome of the Romish Communion, who ſo incenſed my former Friends and relations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, by a report that I was already become a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Miniſter, as made them out of a blind Zeal threaten to deſtroy me, not unlike thoſe who conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt S.

Paul from the conſpiracy of his Brethren againſt him. They ſent by ſeveral ways to ſeek after me, and acquaint me of the danger I was in: they prepared a party to relieve me if any violence should be offered me, and ſent an officer of horſe with other Gentlemen, by the way they underſtood I was to come, to bring me with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity into the City, and prevail with me to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Lord Arch-bishops Palace, to be under his Protection, being not ſecure of my life in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer habitations.</p>

            <p>To this Letter I anſwered immediatly in terms of no leſs kindneſs and ſincere amity, that I did and would declare whereſoever he was concerned, that neither he nor any other of his Society did ever give me any diſcontent, which might be the cauſe of the Reſolution I was upon; that my diſſatisfaction was of a higher nature, and that it was a great error to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that any diſlike of particular Perſons should work in me an alteration of this kind, it being well known how eaſily I might remedy any diſcontents in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by repairing to the place of my former habitation and emploiments in <hi>Spain,</hi> and how good a reception I was to expect there even in that ſeaſon, as to him was well known.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:53284:8"/>leaſt of Chriſtianity if not of Religion, may remain entire among us.</hi> He deſired further that I would conſider ſeriouſly <hi>unde</hi> &amp; <hi>quo,</hi> whence and whither I was going, and what great inconveniencies might follow.</p>
            <p>To this Letter alſo I anſwered immediatly, repet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my former aſſurances given to him, of no injury or diſcontent received from him, or any of his Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, as a cauſe or occaſion of my change, and that I did heartily embrace his offer of maintaining union of Chriſtianity among us, if not of Religion, which was my own conſtant inclination and hearty deſire. As for conſidering <hi>unde</hi> &amp; <hi>quo,</hi> whence and whither I went, that I did conſider it with Prayer and Study of many years, and the grounds of my reſolution thereupon would ſoon appear in public; and I deſired he should prevail with ſome able men of his Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to reply to them with that gravity and modeſty, which becometh learned and religious men; that on both ſides, we might concur with our ſtudies, to the Glory of God, and manifeſtation of his truth, ſetting a ſide all wonted acerbities, which if uſed would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm me, and all men of good judgment, in a diſlike of their way and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Soon after, at my arrival in <hi>Dublin,</hi> he ſent another Letter to me of the 24. of <hi>June,</hi> with a meſſage by word of mouth, by a Gentleman of my Relation, earneſtly craving an opportunity of a privat confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with me, with an offer made by the ſaid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of all favor and aſſiſtance, if I did deſiſt even then from proceeding in my reſolution, and deſired I would ſignify either in privat, or in public, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my diſcontent with them. To this I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I conceived ſome inconveniencies in privat Conferences in that occaſion, and expected no quiet of mind by them; that the caſe being already public, I judged the handling of it in public to be more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient both for the Service of God, and my particular ſatisfaction, the matter going through a more exact Trial that way; and conſequently I did proceed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring in a Sermon preached a few daies after, to a
<pb facs="tcp:53284:8"/>very great and noble Auditory in <hi>Chriſts Church</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the reaſons of my diſcontent with the preſent practice of the Roman Church, in ſuch moderate terms, as may be ſeen in the ſame Sermon printed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the hands of many, deſiring to be anſwered with the like moderation, and formal Style, ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſatyrical, and ſcurrilous Libels, to which I was not to afford any either reading or anſwer. And long it was before I heard of any ſerious reply made to my propoſals, but ſilly Libels of this latter kind, which the ſober ſort of their own party thought unworthy to be published, and I thought them to be as little worthy of my regard. In the mean time having taken my dwelling, ſince my coming to <hi>Dublin,</hi> in <hi>Trinity Colledg</hi> near it, and that Univerſity being pleaſed to have me incorporated with it, in the quality of Doctor in Divinity, at the performance of Acts uſual to ſuch a degree, I published a Divinity Theſis, directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a Juſtification of my reſolution taken, by a ſtrict enquiry and examen of it in a public diſpute, and containing to that purpoſe two concluſions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the main points of our Controverſy, and to which all the reſt may be reduced.</p>
            <p>The firſt was, <hi>That out of the Roman Church there is a ſafe way for Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second, <hi>that the way of the Church of England, is ſafer to Salvation then that of the Church of Rome.</hi> By the former I intended to juſtify my conſtant and continual averſion to that horrid and arrogant poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Romaniſts, that out of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion there is no Salvation, the fountain of ſo many bloody Tragedies, and unchriſtian animoſities, which have bin the diſgrace and deſtruction of the Chriſtian Church theſe many years. By the Second, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to juſtify the election I made of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the more ſure way to Salvation, each one being obliged by the law of that Charity which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ows to himſelf, to take the way he conceives to be moſt ſecure in a matter of ſo high a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:53284:10"/>and now Dear <hi>Andrew,</hi> ſweet <hi>Andrew,</hi> and what not.</p>
            <p>With what propriety his book may be called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſon I know not, if it be not, that the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he beſtows upon me in one place, may be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt the venem he and his fellow railers ſpit againſt me in others. You have bin heretofore (ſaies he) <hi>known and counted a Philoſopher, both by words and deeds, you ſpoke great things, and did likewiſe practiſe them,</hi> and after p. 27. <hi>before you were</hi> vir Apoſtolicus <hi>a moſt reſplendent Star in the Firmament of the true Church, a Religious Prieſt, conferring life of grace on others, called by the hand of God to a moſt high and Soveraign dignity and Honor, before a chast and Evangelical Miſſioner, raiſed from a</hi> Sall <hi>to be a</hi> Paul, <hi>a Preacher of the word and penance. Now turned to be</hi> Saul <hi>perſecuting, and warring in a moſt furious manner, againſt the heavenly fortreſs of true faith, become a wretched lying and vile Proteſtant,</hi> plunged in all vices contrary to thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer virtues, not to repete more of his dirty terms.</p>
            <p>A grave and Honorable prelate reading this ſtrange Contrapoſition; replied they were beholding to him for giving ſo good account of what I was before, but needed not his information for what I am now, themſelves knowing that better. And this egregious wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being queſtioned in a private diſcourſe, with what truth he could ſay that I was become ſo deboiſt, ſince I came to the reformed Church, living all that time very abſtemious, and retired in Trinity Colledg of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in a good repute with thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with me, he anſwered that he never meant that I should be really guilty of thoſe vices, but in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical ſence, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> being a Harlot, I embraceing the Communion of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came guilty of a ſpiritual uncleanneſs, and all thoſe vices he mentions. He cannot deny that I know this to have bin his anſwer. Wee thought ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations, and mental windings to be only among the prime Politicians of that party, but when we find them in one ſo ſimple as Mr. <hi>I. E.</hi> his book shews
<pb facs="tcp:53284:11"/>him to be, the ſickneſs ſeems to be too far ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Well contented he would be that his proſelytes should underſtand I should be really guilty of the debauchery he ſpeaks of. But if he be brought to a teſt, he is provided of the reſerve aforeſaid to come of.</p>
            <p>This ſpecimen which I give of the mans Genius, will I preſume quit me, in good Judgments of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to further regard of what he ſaies to me: but I will not diſcharge my ſelf of the duty of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt his barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and calumnies, which I will perform God willing in the whole diſcourſe of this Treatiſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the objections of others, and with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions at the end upon part of his peculiar Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances, to let the world know, how different the condition of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is for Piety and learning, from what his malice would make his blind Flock believe of it.</p>
            <p>The next book of thoſe published againſt me that came to my hand, was one intitled the <hi>Bleeding Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia,</hi> by way of a Preface to another greater a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, which ſoon after appeared under the Title of the <hi>Dolefull fall of Andrew Sall &amp;c.</hi> both written by a grave and ancient Prelate of my acquaintance in <hi>Spain;</hi> who in both of them dolefully laments a ſuppoſed fall of mine from the Catholic faith into Hereſy, and enlarges in magnifying the virtues and learning of the prime Fathers and Doctors of the Church whoſe company he ſaies I have forſaken, and cries againſt the errors and vices of many Heretics which he mentions, drawing their pedegry down from <hi>Cain,</hi> whoſe ſociety he ſaies I have embraced, and concludes conjuring me by all that is Holy and precious on earth, and in Heaven, that when the laſt viſit of God comes upon me, I may be found a true profeſſor of the Holy Roman Catholic Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic Faith.</p>
            <p>The good will and Pious intention of this Prelate I truly love and honor, and accordingly will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to ſatisfy him in ſober, ſerious, and ſincere terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53284:11"/>
If it were ſo indeed as he ſuppoſes, that I should have fallen from the Holy Catholic Apoſtolic Faith, I should be the moſt unhappy, and worthy to be lamented of all men; but I am certainly perſwaded I have rather faſtened my ſelf to it, by the change I made, &amp; I hope shall make it appear ſo to all unbiaſſed men in the progreſs of this book. And to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that I be found a true Profeſſor of the holy Catholic Apoſtolic faith, I promiſe him faithfully, it shall be my conſtant and inflexible reſolution to hold that faith to the end of my life, whereſoever it be uncorruptly profeſſed, whether in <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or elſe where; I know it is not tied to places. And in truth and ſincerity of my heart, I ſay to God in the words of holy <hi>David,</hi> which I have put for a Motto in the Frontiſpiece of this work, <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the daies of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in his Temple.</hi> Pſal. 27.4. This deſire appeared early in me, having betaken my ſelf in my younger years, to that courſe of life, which I conceived to be moſt expedient to come to God, and dwell in his houſe, by the ſtrict practiſe of Piety and learning, ſecluded from the world in a ſociety of great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for both. And in that courſe I did perſevere, whilſt that apprehenſion laſted: but having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered errors therein oppoſit to the primitive Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and Apoſtolic faith, leading to the houſe of God, and finding by ſerious and due conſiderations, the ſame true faith to be profeſſed uncorruptly in the reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> I did conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to embrace it, in proſecution of my foreſaid profeſſed deſign of dwelling in the houſe of God, I mean in the true Catholic Apoſtolic Church. And as no human force or induſtry, could win me to this change, without a ſtrong interiour motion, and full perſwaſion of being in the right, ſo all arts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours by terrors or allurements are vain to recal me, this interior perſwaſion perſiſting, which I find
<pb facs="tcp:53284:12"/>rather confirmed then weakened by all induſtry hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto uſed to draw me from it, as I hope will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the diſpaſſioned reader by the ſincerity of my diſcourſes in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt book of thoſe published againſt me that came to my hands, was one of J. S. bearing Title the <hi>unerring unerrable Church.</hi> Whoſoever the ſaid J. S. be, if we meaſure him by his conceit of himſelf, his contemt of his adverſaries, his boaſt of his arguments for unanſwerable, and the brags of his Friends in his behalf for matchleſs, certainly he is the <hi>Goliah</hi> of their <hi>Camp,</hi> of Gigantic ſtature among them. I was not a little joied to find a perſon of ſo great repute and truſt, engaged in anſwering my arguments. If I find it eaſy to render void his anſwers, and to confute his arguments, then may I expect to be at full quiet in my perſwaſion, and immoveable againſt all their oppoſitions, whereof the prudent Reader will be judg after he hath viewed our incounter.</p>
            <p>And whereas the main ſtrength of this Combatant lies in his calumnies and impoſtures, wherewith he beſets thick the front or Preface of his Book, I will in this place remove that engine. To leſſen the weight of my arguments with a great number of Readers, who rely much upon the credit of the writer, he will, he ſaies, ſtrip me of thoſe Titles which my public emploiments for many years have given me, and with a kind of power never heard of before, will make, that I should not have bin what really I was, to the knowledg of many thouſands of men living. Finding me ſtiled Profeſſor of controverſies, in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Colledg of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> he ſaies reſolutely, that no Controverſies were taught in that Colledg theſe forty yeares: in which undertaking he has bin ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky, that ſeveral perſons of Honor in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who have bin in <hi>Spain,</hi> and do know the language of it, ſaw an Inſtrument in Spanish yet extant in my keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Inquiſitor General of <hi>Spain,</hi> giving me Licence for having and keeping prohibited Books upon the account of being profeſſor of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies

            <p>The Author of this letter is yet living where Mr. S. may come to him and be certified of the caſe. And tho he be of my preſent Antagoniſts, I know he has ſo much of truth and honeſty in him, as not to deny his writing: for even now he confeſſes that his opinion of me, and the opinion of all that knew me, was conforming to what that letter repreſents, whatſoever be come of our preſent Controverſies.</p>
            <p>The ſecond teſtimony I have to be produced here more public and full to this purpoſe, is that of
<pb facs="tcp:53284:16"/>the Earl of <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> General of the Spanish army in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> Vice-Roy and Captain General firſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> then of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and laſt of <hi>Peru,</hi> a Prince of as great repute for his learning and piety, as for his Government of Kingdoms and arms. Being Vice-Roy of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and Reſident in <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plona</hi> Metropolis of that Kingdom, all the time I was there teaching Philoſophy and Divinity, and being often preſent at my public functions, as well of moderating diſputes in Scholes, as of preaching in Churches, and moreover having bin pleaſed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me very familiar with himſelf, for his direction and conſultation in matters belonging to my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and calling, at laſt delivered his opinion of me, for teaching, preaching, and behavior, in an Elogy inſerted among others of men he honored of his age, and would have to live in the memory of poſterity in a book of his works preſented by his two Sons to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> intitled <hi>horae ſucciſivae Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daci Benavidii comitis S<hi rend="sup">ti</hi> Stephani Proregis Navarrae, &amp;c.</hi> and printed at <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France</hi> in the year 1660.

            <p>I forbear turning theſe words into English, both for the inſufficiency I find in me for keeping their Elegancy in the Tranſlation, and for my unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of delivering in words of mine own, Elogies whereof I acknowledg my ſelf moſt unworthy, and which I could not behold without confuſion. The book was ſent unto me by the Bishop of <hi>Pamplona</hi> to be examined before it was printed, as the cuſtom there is, and ſo bears my cenſure and approbation of it in the beginning. But the foreſaid elogy was then concealed from me, and inſerted among the reſt, after the Copy went out of my hands: and
<pb facs="tcp:53284:18"/>truly I was ſurprized, and is no ſmall confuſion finding it in the book after it was printed. But I ſee Gods great providence fore ſeeing the preſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant attemt of my adverſary upon my credit, was pleaſed to have this Antidote prepared againſt his venem.</p>
            <p>I hope the judicious Reader will not aſcribe to any appetit of vain Glory the exhibiting of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid teſtimonies, to which the juſt and neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of my credit did force me. And whereas my adverſary is ſo bold as to appeal even to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant reader, for juſtifying his attemt in robbing me of the Titles given to me, with a confeſſed deſign of weakning thereby my cauſe and my arguments with the vulgar, I embrace the ſame appeal, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſame reader to judg, whether it be right or reaſon I should deſert his cauſe, and mine in this exigency. Shall we let their inſolent and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious vaunt run unchekt, wherewith they blind the ſimple, ſaying that no man of underſtanding or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty can leave their Church for the reformed; that both Religion and learning have fixed their tents among them, ſo as out of their Society neither may be found: that the dulleſt wits coming to them, are illuminated and refined, and the moſt ſublime, by leaving their Communion, are blinded and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>This robber of titles certainly shall meet with ſomething in his Encounter with me, that will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him more then thoſe callings of Profeſſor and Rector. Many Profeſſors of Divinity and Rectors of Colledges have I known (without any great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumtion I may ſay it) who in debates of this kind, could not put their oppoſers into ſuch ſtreights as I. S is like to find himſelf in, at the trial of his book, now to be taken in hand. But being he conceives that thoſe callings may add force to my arguments with ſome readers, I will defend them in ſpight of his malice, and endeavor to forward the truth of God, by all that is mine by right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53284:18"/>
And if it be true what ſome of his party, to give more credit to this calumny, do report, ſaying that the Author of it is a Jeſuit of my acquaintance in <hi>Spain,</hi> if ſo, I ſay, his guilt is hainouſſy aggravated thereby, as being a formal and willful impoſtor with certain knowledg of the untruth of what he ſaies, he having bin a maſter of a Grammar School in one of thoſe Colledges where I was Profeſſor of Divinity, and where he ſays Divinity was never taught, and knowing certainly that I had all thoſe emploiments which he denies I should have had; for which cauſe ſeveral of the Romish Clergy and Laity in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who know the ſame, have deteſted the impudence of this man, in denying a thing ſo publicly known.</p>
            <p>I could not but imagin that ſome perſon capable himſelf of ſo deſperate a folly as to take upon him fictitious titles, should be author of this rude calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: for mens apprehenſions of others are commonly a teſtimony of their own temper, as is obſerved in the beginning of this Preface. And if the ſaid Jeſuit be Author of that book and of the calumnies of it, the obſervation now mentioned is fully verified in him: for to my certain knowledg, this man being ſent away from <hi>Spain</hi> before he was ripe in learning, to magnify his miſſion with privat friends, gave himſelf a title, ſo ridiculouſly and Chimerically fictitious, that if I did mention it here, it would bring upon him an incurable confuſion; not to wound him to deeply, I forbear to unfold the matter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at preſent. But I have declared it to a perſon of quality of his acquaintance with a meſſage to him and his brethren, that if they will not ſtand to the offer of their Superior above mentioned, of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Chriſtianity and civill demeanor, nor will accept of my invitation to a trial of our cauſe by a grave and Scholaſtic way, becoming Chriſtians and learned men, but muſt force me out of it by calumnies and ſlanders, they may poſſibly find, that it is not want of materials, that keeps me from throwing dirt in their face (as others commonly do
<pb facs="tcp:53284:19"/>departing from them) but want of inclination to ſuch practiſes: and when their
<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Caramvel Theolog, fundamentali fundamento 551. N. 1589.</note> great Doctors teach them to raiſe falſe teſtimonies whereby to diſcredit their adverſaries, as this man does, I hope they will allow me to repell with truth, tho bitter, the aſſaults of malicious enemies.</p>
            <p>After the publication of theſe four Books, now mentioned, the laſt and great engin applied by my former brethren to recall me, was a large and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Bull of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 10. now reigning in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſigned and Sealed by his <hi>Protonotarius Apoſtolicus, Claudius Agrete,</hi> aſſuring me in terms of full Legality, an intire and abſolute Remiſſion of all that is paſt, and a favorable reception to my former condition and priviledges, if I would return to them. This Bull came into my hands by <hi>Dublin</hi> poſt in <hi>September</hi> laſt, with a letter about it of few lines in Latin, without ſubſcription, inticeing me to an acceptance of the favor offered, and concluding with admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing me of evil deſign'd againſt me, if I did not conſent to it; of which deſigns againſt me, I have had more notice given to me, then I am willing to publish: I thank God for delivering me hitherto, and I pray that he may correct the ill affected minds that harbor ſuch cruel thoughts.</p>
            <p>To the offer made by that Bull of pardon and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I anſwer, that I want a more neceſſary indult from the true ſupreme Head of the Church our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, for ſubmitting to the preſent Laws and Commands of the Roman Church, oppoſit, as I do conceive, to the Commandments of God, the Doctrine of Chriſt, and the practiſe of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Apoſtolical Church, as I hope to make appear in the following Treatiſe to the indifferent Reader, by the help of God.</p>
            <p>And finding the above mentioned I. S. more eager in challenging me to anſwer his Syllogiſms, and his
<pb facs="tcp:53284:19"/>party more confident of them, I haſtned my reply to him for the print, but ſome delaies intervening which gave me way to have the ſecond part (which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> intended to be of my reply) finished, before this other could be printed, I have reſolved to leave his own place to Mr. I. S. which is the laſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with my reply to N. N. declaring by occaſion of his objections, that the faith we profeſs in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is that (and no other) which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles taught, and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the faithful, in the firſt and better ages of Chriſtianity; that we have in this Church all thoſe titles, and rights which do qualify a Church for truly Catholic, even according to the rules preſcribed by the ableſt writers of the Romish party, whereby all thoſe loud cries againſt us for Heretics and Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maties appear to be no better then emty bubles, and meer wind, only apt to delude weak and ignorant people; and thence I will proceed to declare how their ordinary ſtuffe of arguments againſt us, is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed conſtanly upon falſe ſuppoſitions and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of our Doctrin and practices, which if well known to the ſober and ſincere ſort of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics, they would be far otherwiſe affected then they are towards the Church of England, by the falſe informations of ignorant or malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors.</p>
            <p>O may the Father of light and the God of truth open the eies of men blinded with earthly paſſons, that they may ſee and follow the true way to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs declared to us by his dear Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that his will and glory may be the common aime of all our wishes and writing, and of all our actions; that our Studies and endeavors be not to make the breach among Chriſtians wider, but to reconcile them in Chriſt, that thus united in him, we be at length happily united among our ſelves in the profeſſion of true faith in our good Saviour Jeſus, to whom with the Father and Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory for ever and ever <hi>Amen.</hi>

He is pleas'd to give me marks of former acquaintance for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, but without commiſſion of further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering him to the Reader, then under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>N. N.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the beginning of his Preface, (which came forth in a ſeparate Tractate) he tells me how much he was ſurpris'd and troubled, ſeeing a Copy (he receiv'd in Print from <hi>London</hi>) of my Declaration for the Church of <hi>England. This paper indeed</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>gave me a great heavineſs of heart, for I lov'd the Man dearly, for his ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature and excellent parts, and eſteemed him both a pious perſon and a learned, and ſo did all that knew him.</hi> And after bemoaning my fall (as he calls it) <hi>from a little heaven, the ſtate of Religion, wherein</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>for a time he ſhined, like a little Star, in vertue and learning,</hi> he declares his anger againſt me, and purpoſe of ſerving me not with the Waters of <hi>Shiloah</hi> that go ſoftly, but with thoſe of <hi>Rezin</hi> more tumultuous, to waſh me from the ſtains of <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after this, leaving me, he falls abruptly on lamenting the miſeries of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of injuries done to the natives of it,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53284:26"/>and juſtifying their proceedings in their late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, which he will not have to be called Rebellion. In this he ſpends that Tractate, and then proceeds to the greater Book deſign'd againſt me, giving to it this title, <hi>The doleful fall of</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Sall, <hi>Jeſuite of the fourth vow, from the Roman Catholic and Apoſtolic faith, lamented by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant friend, with an open rebuking of his embracing the Confeſſion contained in the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles of the Church of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Book he begins with a Rhetorical, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical exclamation againſt my reſolution of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the ſaid Confeſſion: and proceeds to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late at large the vertues and learning of Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy Doctors of the Church, whoſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he ſaies I have forſaken: and then makes a large liſt of Heretics of all ages beginning with <hi>Luciſer,</hi> whom he will have to be the firſt <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> before Mans creation, and ſo coming down all along by <hi>Cain, Lamech,</hi> the Giants, <hi>Cham, Jannes,</hi> and <hi>Jambre,</hi> with others mentioned in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ, to theſe of the latter times, relating their execrable vices and errors; of all which he will have me to be guilty, and an aſſociate of thoſe Heretics, for embracing the Confeſſion contained in the 39 Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He pretends to diſcuſs, and cenſure ſome of them, as alſo ſome parts of my Declaration, and makes a ſcandalous Narrative of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformation, and finally concludes with a fervent exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me to return to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53284:27"/>
By this <hi>Scheme</hi> I deliver of that Book, the prudent Reader may judge how tedious a labour it were to take notice of every thing contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, and how impertinent, I being ſo far from what he ſuppoſes me to be, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerned in the <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and for the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics</hi> he mentions. Yet the quality of the perſon, the ſacred tye of friendſhip which he profeſſes for me, and the good intention I am to believe he had in his writing, and above all the love of truth oblig'd me to undeceive him, and others that may be of his opinion, in the great and groſs miſtake he is in touching my condition, and that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion I have embrac'd. I will therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Religion we profeſs in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church of <hi>England,</hi> is no other then the true, Primitive, Catholic, and Apoſtolic Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taught by our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and practis'd in the firſt and purer ages by the Primitive Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That we have nothing to do with the <hi>Hereſies N. N.</hi> attributes to us: and his Brethren practiſing ſuch calumnies, do manifeſt it is not the Spirit of God that moves them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the profeſſors of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Doctrine in the Reformed Churches are not ſo few or deſpicable, nor the <hi>Romiſh</hi> facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo conſiderable, as they would make the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53284:27"/>
Fourthly and laſtly, I will refute ſome ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrines delivered in his firſt Book, that is a preface to the ſecond, and will conclude with a check to <hi>J. E.</hi> his calumnies and barbarous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes faſtned on the Proteſtant Church.</p>

               </head>
               <p>YOu begin the firſt Chapter of your Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, <hi>N. N.</hi> (under this character you will be named,) You begin I ſay, with a Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical exclamation in theſe terms, <hi>O</hi> Sall, <hi>tell us what domincering Spirit of darkneſs, what black tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation hath drawn you out of the houſe of God?</hi> I may juſtly return for anſwer an other exclamation better grounded, and ſay, O <hi>N. N.</hi> tell us what domineering ſpirit of blindneſs, what black preſumtion is this, that ſo generally poſſeſſes your faction amidſt the light of ſo learn'd an age, that a perſon of your years and degree ſhould not know, <hi>that in the Houſe of my Heavenly Father there are many Manſions?</hi> that it extends further then the quarters of the <hi>Roman Pope?</hi> that by quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his juriſdiction, I forſake not the whole houſe of God? But tho you declare to your Reader, that your purpoſe is not to deal with me Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtically, but Hiſtorically, that is to ſay, (as I find) not by reaſon, but by railing, and by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, wherewith your uſual armories are plentifully ſtored, and by emty flouriſhes upon falſe grounds; I will not engage in like manner
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53284:28"/>with you, but prove Scholaſtically, that is to ſay, with formal and ſolid arguments demonſtrate, that in all your cries you beat the air and not me; that all of them are grounded upon a falſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; that by forſaking the <hi>Romiſh</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I did not forſake the Catholic Church; that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe communion I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, is a very noble and ſound member of the Catholic Church, and the Doctrine profeſſed in it, &amp; propoſed to the People for the object of their belief, is truly Catholic and Apoſtolic, free from all Hereſie and falſhood. And when I have proved ſo much in a rational and Scholaſtic ſtyle and method, it will appear how vain your attemt is of working on me, by loud cries againſt Hereſies wherein I am not concern'd, as if you were hunting a wild Boar in a forreſt to drive him by clamor and ſhouting into your nets. It is reaſon that wins me, and whereby I deſire to win others, not exclamations and cries of that kind.</p>
               <p>I will not repete the juſt complaints delivered by many learned Writers of the arrogance of your party, of their abſurdity and impropriety of terms in pretending that they alone are the Catholic, that is to ſay the Univerſal Church, being at the beſt but a part of it, and the ſame very corrupt, and not the greater part but the leſs by very much, as hereafter will appear.</p>
               <p>To go through with my engagement of proving by Scholaſtical exact reaſons, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a true Catholic Church, I'le take up the arguments urged againſt this verity by one of the ableſt Schoolmen that ever wrote in favour of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53284:29"/>your cauſe, employed by the <hi>Pope</hi> againſt our great and learned K. <hi>James,</hi> I mean <hi>Francis Suarez</hi> Jeſuit; I will I ſay take up the arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this famous Schoolman pretends to rob the Church of <hi>England</hi> of the glorious title of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, and declare by that way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Logicians after <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> do call <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum mirabile,</hi> that they prove the contrary, and confirm the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its right to the title of a true Catholic and Apoſtolic Church. It will indeed appear a ſingular triumph of truth, that the weakeſt defender of it ſhould wreſt Arms out of the hand of the ableſt oppoſer, and beat him with his own weapons. A trial of this great power of truth, I offer now to the view of the ingenious Reader in my encounter with <hi>Suarez</hi> on this Subject. I will not purſue all the amplifications and excurſions of this voluminous Writer, as not ſuitable to the brevity and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity I intend to follow; yet I will take up the foundations of all his arguments upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and apply them to my purpoſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franciſcus Suarez</hi> in his volume entituled, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſio Fidei Catholicae &amp; Apoſtolicae adverſus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicanae ſectae errores,</hi> in his firſt Book from the 12. Chapter of it forward, endeavours to prove, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not a Catholic Church, &amp; therefore that the Faith of it is not a Catholic Faith. The firſt foundation he laies to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is this, that theſe two things <hi>Catholic Faith</hi> and <hi>Catholic Church</hi> are ſo united, as the one may not be found ſeparate from the other, ſo that no Church may be Catholic wherein the Catholic
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53284:29"/>Faith is not profeſſed, neither may the Catholic Faith be found in any Church that is not Catholic. Thence he proceeds to prove, that the Roman Church is Catholic, becauſe it has a continual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the firſt Church that was ſo called, and retaineth the ſame Faith which the primitive Catholic Apoſtolic Church did profeſs; for which he cites <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaying, <hi>Doctrinam Catholicam eſſe in Eccleſiâ Romanenſi,</hi> that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church Catholic Doctrine is profeſſed, which is as much (ſaies <hi>Suarez</hi>) as if he had ſaid, its a Catholic Church: from all which <hi>Suarez</hi> concludes <hi>n.</hi> 13. that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not Catholic, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor united with it, and there is but one Catholic Church, as we confeſs in the <hi>Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How hard a task <hi>Suarez</hi> has in proving to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete his argument, that in the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that Faith, and no other, is taught which the ancient Church called Catholic did teach, may appear by all my former diſcourſes againſt their new coin'd Articles never mentioned in the Primitive Church.</p>
               <p>But my preſent work will be to ſhew, how his argument wherewith he pretends to prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be the Catholic, doth with more force evince the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be truly Catholic. And thus I form it to that purpoſe. In whatſoever Church that Faith is profeſſed which was taught in the ancient Church firſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Catholic and Apoſtolic, that Church is truly Catholic and Apoſtolic: In the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
                  <note place="bottom">Tertul. in praeſcriptionibus, cap. xx.</note>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53284:30"/>is profeſſed that Faith, which was taught by the ancient Church firſt called Catholic and Apoſtolic; therefore the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is truly Catholic and Apoſtolic. If we prove the minor propoſition, <hi>Suarez</hi> cannot in juſtice deny the conſequence. And if he will inſiſt upon his pretention of ſuch a diſunion of his Church with that of <hi>England</hi> that both may not be Catholic, let the ſecond conſequence be of his own making, that their Church is no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church: for it is not my intention to make them worſe then the Doctors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do, who allow them to be members, tho corrupt, of the Catholic Church. The minor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition wherein the ſtreſs of my argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, I prove thus; The Faith taught by the ancient Church, firſt called Catholic and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, is that contained in the three <hi>Creeds,</hi> that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And truly it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53284:30"/>but appear ſtrange, that any Chriſtian, not blinded with partiality or prejudice, ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the ſacred Apoſtles, intruſted to preach ſaving Doctrine to all the World, ſhould not have given a ſufficient notice of it in the ſyſtem of Articles they left to us: That thoſe venerable Fathers of the purer ages of Chriſtianity, congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the four firſt general Councils, ſhould give us but a diminute account of Catholic and Apoſtolic belief: that the <hi>Popes</hi> Infallibility, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and other articles of latter impreſſion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſhould be ſo eſſential to Chriſtian Faith, as none may be ſaved without a belief of them.</p>
               <p>This argument may be confirmed by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> related by <hi>Suarez</hi> in the chapter above mentioned, <hi>num.</hi> 2. ſaying, that the collection of Articles contained in his <hi>Creed</hi> is the Catholic Faith: <hi>haec eſt Fides Catholica, &amp;c.</hi> this is the Catholic Faith, which except a Man believe he cannot be ſaved: but in the Church of <hi>England</hi> that Faith called Catholic and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is believed and profeſſed, therefore if any Church profeſſing the Catholic Faith is Catholic it ſelf, the Church of <hi>England</hi> profeſſing this Catholic Faith, is truly Catholic.</p>
               <p>The ſecond foundation laid by <hi>Suarez</hi> in the ſame chapter <hi>n.</hi> 6. to prove that his Church is Catholic, is to ſay, that it did in all times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Faith of that Creed, wherein the Church is called Catholic: But the Church of <hi>England</hi> does and alwaies did profeſs the Faith of the ſame Creed; therefore it has the ſame right to the like calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53284:31"/>
The third foundation laid by <hi>Suarez</hi> from the 15. <hi>num.</hi> of the ſaid chapter, is a ſign or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive uſed by ancient Fathers for to know a Church or Congregation truly Catholic, and to diſtinguiſh it from another not Catholic; That whenſoever any Sect takes its name from the maſter or teacher of ſuch a Doctrine, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of it do call themſelves by ſuch a name, neither the Doctrine nor the followers of it are Catholic: For which he alledg'd the teſtimony of <hi>Athanaſius, Chryſoſtom, Lactantius,</hi> and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And the reaſon or cauſe of this diſtinctive is, that every Hereſie brings in ſome novelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ancient Faith, and new things muſt have new names whereby to be known and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from others.</p>
               <p>But it is very remarkable how this ſubtil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant, otherwiſe very exact and formal in his diſcourſes, pretending to rob the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of the name of Catholic by the principle now mentioned, comes to confirm the ſame name upon it, not finding it capable of the foreſaid note of a Sect not Catholic. For pretending to name it from <hi>Calvin,</hi> he finds an obſtacle in it, becauſe <hi>Calvin</hi> do's not approve a chief Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it. Then he paſſes to call it <hi>Henrician</hi> from King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eigth, becauſe from him the Church of <hi>England</hi> did learn to acknowledg the King for Head or ſupreme Governour of the Church in his own dominions. Againſt this alſo he meets with ſeveral obſtacles, to which I will add this other very conſiderable, that this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is by many ages more ancient then the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53284:31"/>whereas it allows no other Supremacy to our King over the Church, then ſuch as the Godly Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Chriſtian Emperors in the Primitive Church did exerciſe in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Dominions, as is declared in the 37. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and in the ſecond <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> Since <hi>Suarez,</hi> can not find the name of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran, Calviniſt, Henrician,</hi> or any other taken from any particular Author, or teacher, to be agreeable to this Church, it muſt follow from the above mentioned note of a Catholic Church delivered by him, and taken out of ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it is a Church truly Catholic, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only name it ſelf own's. And the Preachers of it, praying for our <hi>King,</hi> do ſtile him <hi>Defender of the Faith truly Catholic and Apoſtolic;</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> in his Monitory to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and other Chriſtian Princes, ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Defender of the Faith truly Chriſtian, Catholic and Apoſtolic, of the ancient and Primitive Church;</hi> and we do all pray heartily, that our Kings may never defend any other Faith then this.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Suarez</hi> endeavours to prove, that all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of Univerſality belonging to a Catholic Church, are wanting to this of <hi>England,</hi> that it may be called Catholic.

                  </gap>h as know the ſpirit of that Court, may eaſily believe, that if this great point of the Supremacy, the foundation of their power and grandeur were agreed upon, they would eaſily wink at other diſſentions. Whereof we have a pregnant teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> Lib. 3. <hi>de Eccleſia</hi> Cap. 20. aſſerting, that even ſuch as have no interiour Faith, nor any Chriſtian vertue, are to be taken for members of the Catholic Church, provided they do but outwardly profeſs the Faith of the Roman Church, and ſubjection to the <hi>Pope,</hi> tho it be only for ſome temporal intereſt. So ready they are in <hi>Rome</hi> to embrace all ſorts of men, provided they acknowledg the <hi>Popes</hi> Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. This being eſtabliſhed, all is well; being denyed, the beſt of Men and ſoundeſt Believers in Chriſt muſt be damned Heretics by ſentence of that Court.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall declare ſufficiently in the 15. Chapter of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part of this Treatiſe, how
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53284:33"/>vain the pretence of <hi>Suarez</hi> and his party is, to make the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy an article of ſaving Faith; how unjuſt and tyrannical an uſurpation it is: how far the beſt <hi>Popes</hi> in the Primitive Church were from pretending to it, and more from preſſing it upon Chriſtians as an article of ſaving Faith. And indeed it muſt appear ſtrange to any impartial judgment, that the Syſtem of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles contained in the three Creeds and four firſt general Councels, which gained the name of Catholic to the Church firſt called ſo, ſhould not ſuffice to make a Church Catholic in all times. Therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> profeſſing all thoſe Articles is to be taken for truly Catholic, tho denying the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy, not contained in the foreſaid Syſtem, nor ever own'd by the Church firſt called Catholic, as hereafter will be proved.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond ſort of Univerſality, conſiſting in taking the Word of God for a common reaſon or rule of belief, how can any pretend the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be deficient herein, having ever proteſted that the Word of God contained in Canonical Scripture is the prime and only rule of its belief, while the Roman Church denies to ſtand to this rule, as unable to make out all the belief it would force upon us. What <hi>Suarez</hi> pretends, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> wants a rule infallible for knowing which is true Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the true meaning of it, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to have themſelves in the <hi>Popes</hi> infallibility, I ſhall declare in the eighth Chap. of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part of this Treatiſe how vain it is, we having in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal tradition, and in the Writings of the Holy Fathers, means ſufficiently certain for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53284:34"/>which is the true Scripture, and which the true meaning of it in points neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for others leſs neceſſary, if there be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and diverſity of opinions among our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo is there among theirs, nor could their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Infallibility ever make them agree. Nay among the beſt and wiſeſt Fathers of the Church there was alwaies a great diverſity of opinions in points not fundamental, without breach of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic and Chriſtian union.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the third kind of union or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality, conſiſting in a hierarchical order of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, <hi>&amp;c. Suarez</hi> is much miſtaken in ſaying, that we have them not true and legal. I will declare at large from the fifth Chapter following, that we have all the ſecurity they have, of a legal ſuceſſion and true ordination of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons. Its their concern we ſhould not be found deficient herein: for any defect conceived in our hierachy will reflect upon theirs.</p>
               <p>Finally touching the fourth manner of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, ſignified by the name <hi>Catholic,</hi> that a Church or Faith ſo called ſhould be extended over all the Earth, <hi>Suarez</hi> exceeds much in denying this property to the Church of <hi>England</hi> or Faith profeſſed in it, ſaying it paſſes not the bounds of <hi>Brittiſh</hi> land. To which is contrary that grave and modeſt teſtimony of King <hi>James,</hi> related by <hi>Suarez</hi> in the ſame place, chapter xv. <hi>n</hi> 6. <hi>Nos Dei beneſicio nec numero, nec dignitate ita ſumus contemnendi, qui <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I ſhall declare hereafter from the XIX.

               <p>
                  <hi>Suarez</hi> preventing a check to his argument from this diſcovery in the XVI. Chapter num. 4. of his ſaid Book, premiſes, that this general extenſion of the Catholic Church over all the World, is to be underſtood of extenſion either by right or by actual poſſeſſion, and tho the latter be deficient, the former of right cannot want, Chriſt having commanded that his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhould be preached to all the World.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53284:35"/>Word of God contained in the Goſpel, and in the other Canonical Scriptures, while the Roman preaches articles coined by her ſelf, and never given to the Apoſtles to be preached, as we ſhall ſhew abundantly hereafter, refuting the errors of it.</p>

Secondly, that it be conveyed to us by legal tradition and ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53284:36"/>&amp; habemus annumerare eos qui ab Apoſtolis inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ſunt Epiſcopi in Eccleſiis &amp; ſucceſſores eorum uſque ad nos.</hi> Who are willing to hear truth muſt look upon the tradition of the Apoſtles in all Churches, and we can number thoſe that were ordained <hi>Biſhops</hi> by the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours to our own times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suarez</hi> pretends theſe two requiſites to be wanting in the Church of <hi>England</hi> to merit the Name of <hi>Apoſtolic.</hi> Firſt, ſaies he, becauſe the Doctrine of it was not preached by the Apoſtles, neither was it taken out of their Doctrine, or conveyed to us by lawful tradition. Againſt which poſition he brings King <hi>James</hi> proteſting himſelf to believe, admit and reverence the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture, the three Creeds, and the firſt four General Councils, in which ſacred foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains he judged the Apoſtolic Faith to be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>Suarez</hi> acknowledges that King <hi>James</hi> ſpoke herein not only his own ſenſe but the ſenſe and belief of the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is no ſmall glory to it.</p>
               <p>But how can <hi>Suarez</hi> make out, that the Apoſtolic Faith and Doctrine is not ſufficiently contained in thoſe ſacred Fountains of the Scriptures, Creeds and Councils received by the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?</hi> See Reader and admire his anſwer. Tho the Doctrine of the ſaid Books conſidered in it ſelf (ſaies he) be Catholic Apoſtolic Faith (or rather a part of it, for he pretends that all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Faith is not contained in thoſe fountains) yet as it is received by ſectaries, either it is not Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, or it may not be certainly taken for ſuch. Firſt, becauſe they cannot be certain whether
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53284:36"/>thoſe Books they receive be Canonical, or the Councils legal. Secondly, that they cannot be certain of the true meaning of the Scriptures Creeds or Councils. So that in concluſion, the Divinity of our Saviour, preached by a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt is Catholic Apoſtolic Faith; but not ſo, when preached by one of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I ſhould indeed think this only conſequence to be a ſufficient confutation of this unhappy ſubtilty of <hi>Suarez:</hi> but further to his reaſon; when effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively we are ſecured that the Scripture recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us is truly Canonical and Divine, and our adverſaries do allow it, what need is there for quarrelling about the grounds and motives of our ſecurity therein? and touching the ſenſe both of Scripture, Creeds &amp; Councils; the

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Succeſſion and lawful Ordination of</hi> Biſhops, Prieſts, <hi>and</hi> Deacons, <hi>in the Reformed Church of</hi> England.</head>
               <p>NOthing is affirmed more confidently, nothing more blindly believed by moſt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh party, then the nullity of the Proteſtant Clergy, that our <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> are not ſuch effectively, but nominally, or by title, and therefore unable to give Orders they have not, or adminiſter Sacraments depending upon ſuch Orders. This I find by experience to be the greateſt ſtop, many of the more ſober and ſerious of them have, in embracing the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> They ſee cleerly nothing is aſſerted by it which may be thought Heretical or erroneous. And what it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſuperſtructures added in latter Ages by the Roman Church, they eaſily perceive them not to be eſſential to Salvation. Their main ſcruple is, whether in this ſeparation of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the Roman, a lawful ſucceſſion of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and Miniſters was retained, and a legal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of them continued: whether they may live and die confidently relying upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the reformed Miniſters for conſecrating,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53284:39"/>abſolving, &amp;c. without recourſe to a Romiſh <hi>Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This point I find to be ſo neceſſary for ſetling the minds of many in this wavering age, that I thought convenient to examine it exactly, as far as may conſiſt with the brevity and clearneſs I aim at in this writing. To relate the reproches and calumnies of Romiſh Writers againſt our Miniſtery were endleſs and impertinent. The ſhorter and readieſt way will be, to ſhew the truth and right of our cauſe by poſitive undeniable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments touching the lawful ſucceſſion and due Ordination of our Clergy. This being eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, old ſtories and ſlanders will fall of themſelves. Who would not think it impertinent in me to take notice of that very rude and ridiculous fable, of the Ordination of <hi>Parker</hi> and others at the <hi>Naggs-head</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> moſt vigorouſly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively refuted many years ago by Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> and unhappily revived of late by a certain Gentleman to his own great ſhame and diſcredit of his cauſe, being evidently convicted of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, by the Lord <hi>Biſhop Bramhal</hi> in a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Treatiſe printed upon that Subject? Such baſe ſtuff as this, if ſuitable to ears poſſeſſed with fury and blind paſſion, is unworthy of any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or regard among ſerious and ſober Men.</p>
               <p>Now coming to the point, after much read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſerious conſideration upon the matter, I wiſh heartily, I could find the ſucceſſion of lawful <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſo cleer and not interrupted in the Roman Church, from the Apoſtles times to the Reformation, as we are able to ſhew it in ours from the beginning of the Reformation to our
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53284:39"/>own daies. It ſhall not be my preſent work to take notice of doubts occurring touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It will ſuffice for my purpoſe to demonſtrate, that from the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight his reign (when no doubt was of the legality of our Clergy) to this day, there has bin a lawful uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion and due Ordination of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and other Inferiour Clergy in the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> If the teſtimony of an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary will avail, we have that of

And on the other ſide, the Romiſh party is found guilty, by unceſſant experiences of aſperſing, without meaſure or regard of truth, the proteſtant cauſe and all defenders of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſtory of Ordination, at the <hi>Nags-head,</hi> confidently revived of late by one of a great
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53284:40"/>calling, and confuted to his ſhame and confuſion by the Lord Primate <hi>Bramhall,</hi> may be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous evidence. To which I could add not a few more of my own experience and certain knowledg. They got a great Perſon to relate in <hi>Dublin,</hi> that I was ſtruck Dumb at making of my Declaration in the Church of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> and that I fell ſuddainly Dead ſoon after, going in the Street. A miracle I ſuppoſe is put by this time into the annual letters of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Indies,</hi> to terrify o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from following my Example. An other Perſon of like quality was emploied to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that after my foreſaid Declaration made at <hi>Caſhel,</hi> an extraordinary concourſe of People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at it, I went to a Noble-Mans Houſe where my habitation was formerly, and ſaid <hi>Maſs</hi> in it: whereas I was not out of the Arch-Biſhops company from that day, until I came to <hi>Dublin</hi> with a conſiderable number of Men and Arms to guard me. And after ſome Months conſtant retirement in the Colledg of <hi>Dublin,</hi> without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lying out of it, or going abroad, but ſeldom to the Caſtle, and few houſes of the chief Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Nobility, an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt told confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to one of my Lord <hi>Chancellors</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (who related it to me after) that he ſaw me few daies before ſaying Maſs at <hi>Kilkullen</hi> Bridg (where I was not in ſome years before that time) after my public Sermon of Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Dublin;</hi> and the Gentleman asking how that could poſſibly be ſo, I being in their ſight and company, and never out of <hi>Dublin</hi> all that time, he took a Book into his hand, and ſwore by it, that what he ſaid was true. At this very
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53284:41"/>inſtant it hapned, that I ſhould come out of Chriſt-Church from Praiers in company of an other Gentleman of the Colledg, and my Lord <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors</hi> Gentleman ſeeing me, asked of the ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whether he did know me if he ſaw me: he anſwered, yea; and asking whether I was of thoſe two that went by, he ſaid no. But being told I was one of them, he confeſſed that he never ſaw me before. So punctual as this are their reports of us. If they were but ſeldom, we might take them for miſtakes; but ſeeing them ſo frequent, and continual, we have too much ground for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting a ſet purpoſe of impoſing upon us, eſpecially their moſt creditable Doctors, teaching them, that tis lawful to raiſe falſe teſtimonies in defence of their credit, that their oppoſers may not be believed. The authors of this godly Doctrine, confeſſors and Preachers to Emperours and Princes, you may ſee quoted by <hi>John Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramuel,</hi> Titular Biſhop of <hi>Miſia</hi> in <hi>Theologia fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentali, fundamento</hi> 55. <hi>n.</hi> 1589.

The ſame Doctrine is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered again in the 23. <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 3. can. of the ſame Council, adding, that who was once a Prieſt can never be made a Layman.

Nam gratia Sacramentalis in ipſa applicatione materiae &amp; formae, &amp; per ipſam confertur.</hi> Whence followeth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, that ſuch impoſition of hands is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and conſequently the words pronounced with it the form: for Sacramental grace is conferred in the very application of the matter and form and by it. Then he proceeds to prove by teſtimonies of Fathers, that three Biſhops ought to concur in the Ordination of a Biſhop, &amp; that what is not performed by all three, belongs not to the eſſential matter or forme. But in all the Roman Pontifical, ſaies he, no other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is appointed to be performed by three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but only the impoſition of hands, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that alone muſt be the matter, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently only the words pronounced with it the form of Epiſcopal Ordination.</p>
               <p>That three Biſhops are neceſſary for ordaining a Biſhop, (which was a foundation laid by him for the former argument), he proves, firſt by the the teſtimony of Pope <hi>Anacletus,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Anaclet. in Epiſt. 2 decretali, c 2. Anicetus, Damas. &amp; alnapod Valgoez. 243. c. 6. an. 63.</note> affirming that the firſt Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem, James</hi> called the juſt, Brother of the Lord according to the fleſh, was ordained by <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Apoſtles, giving therein a rule to ſucceſſors, that a Biſhop ſhould not be ordained by leſs then three Biſhops. <hi>Anacletus</hi> adds, that he learned ſo much from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by whom he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Prieſted. Secondly, Pope <hi>Anicetus</hi> delivers
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53284:46"/>the ſame, adding it was ſo practiced <hi>inſtituente Domino,</hi> by the inſtitution of Chriſt. Thirdly, he alledges the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Councils and Fathers to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If you oppoſe, that the foreſaid words, <hi>Receïve the Holy Ghoſt</hi> are too general for a form to ordain a Biſhop: he anſwers, that being pronounced by three Biſhops laying their hands upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ordained, they ſpecify the degree of a Biſhop, ſince thereby they ſignifie, that they receive him to their own proper order and degree: the conjunction of three Biſhops laying their hands upon the perſon ordained, being only proper to the ordaining of a Biſhop, as he proves <hi>Diſp.</hi> 243. c. 6.

                  <note n="b" place="bottom">Pellar. de Sacra. in Gen. lib. 1. c. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contributes not little to the proof of this verity (tho with leſs coherence to another Doctrine he ſuppoſes, as I will declare after.) For ſpeaking of Sacraments in general, he ſaies, that all Sacraments of the new Law are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of viſible things as matter, and of words, as form. And
<note n="c" place="bottom">Idem de Sacra. ordinis. c. 9.</note> coming to ſpeak of Holy Order, which he ſuppoſes to be a Sacrament, he ſaies that there is no mention in Scripture of any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſign that may be a matter of it, but only the impoſition of hands. Whence it follows, that holy Order being of Divine inſtitution, and declared in Scripture, as he proves well, the eſſential conſtitutes of it muſt be likewiſe in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53284:47"/>Scripture. And therefore no other viſible ſign or matter proportionable for it being in Scripture, it followeth that only the impoſition of hands muſt be the matter of it.</p>
               <p>How well this agrees with what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the ſame place ſuppoſes, but proves not, that in the Ordination of a Prieſt, not only the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, but alſo the delivering of the chalice and patin belong to the eſſential matter, let him conſider. He quotes <hi>Dominic Soto,</hi> and others ſaying, that the delivering the chalice with Wine, and the patin with Bread, is the only matter, and the words pronounced by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop delivering them, is the form of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſt, the words are theſe, <hi>accipe poteſtatem offerendi Sacrificium,</hi> take power of offering a Sacrifice. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proves efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that the impoſition of hands is a matter eſſential to Ordination, but ſuppoſes without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting any proof of it, that the delivering of the chalice and patin is alſo a part eſſential of the matter, ſaying againſt <hi>Sotus,</hi> that not only the delivering of the Inſtruments, but alſo the impoſition of hands, is a matter eſſential in the ordination. This I ſay ſeems not to agree well with what he ſaid before, that in Scripture no mention was made of any Symbol, that could be taken for a matter of Ordination, but only the impoſition of hands. And truly the proof he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges out of <hi>Sotus</hi> or others, that the words of their Pontifical, <hi>accipe poteſtatem offerendi Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium provivis &amp; defunctis,</hi> are contained in thoſe others of our Saviour at the laſt Supper, <hi>hoc facite in meam commemorationem,</hi> Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance

               <p>Now as to the form of Ordination
<note n="*" place="bottom">Bellar. de Sacramento Ordinis lib. 1. c. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, that all agree in taking for form the words that are pronounced by the miniſter when he exhibits the ſenſible ſigns or matter, he adds, that tho the Scripture doth not mention parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular words to be pronounced in each order, yet the ancient Fathers of the Church, <hi>Ambroſe, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> do expreſly teach, that a forme of words ſuitable to each Order is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and was practiced ſo in the ancient Roman Ordinals, and ſo is practiced to this day in the Ordinal of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which in King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth his time was diſpoſed according to the more qualified ancient Ordinals uſed in the Catholic Church. In the Ordination of Deacons, the Biſhop laies his hands ſeverally upon the Head of every one of them, kneeling before him, ſaying, <hi>Take thou authority to execute the office of a Deacon in the Church of God commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto thee, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> After deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to every one of them the New Teſtament, he ſaith, <hi>Take thou authority to read the Goſpel in the Church of God, and to preach the ſame, if thou be thereto licenſed by the Biſhop himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ordaining Prieſts, the Biſhop, with the Prieſts preſent, do lay their hands ſeverally upon the Head of every one that receiveth the order of Prieſthood, the Receivers kneeling, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

               </p>
               <p>In the conſecration of Biſhops, the Archbiſhop and Biſhops preſent, do lay their hands upon the Head of the elected Biſhop kneeling before them and the Archbiſhop, ſaying,</p>

Then <hi>Fitz Symons</hi> was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when he ſaid, that the ſuppoſed alteration in the intention of the Miniſters did annul the Sacrament by conſent of all Catholics, if he will not have <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to be put out of that number; not to take notice of his extravagancy in making the intention of the Miniſter, an eſſential conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Sacrament, nor of the diſmal confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſcomfort he brings upon his proſelytes, by making the effects of Sacraments depending upon the foreſaid intention, whereof no Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Sacrament can have a full certainty: the words of the Miniſter I can hear and his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I can ſee, but of his intention I can never be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aſſured.</p>

                  <q>This Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> was as it were a treaſure of Eccleſiaſtic Diſcipline, not newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, but uſed by the ancient, and reſtored to the former cuſtom.</q> He adds that this Council was taken as a pattern by the other Churches, both Eaſtern and Weſtern.</p>
               <p>I have peruſed carefully this Council, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it with our form of ordination ſet down in the Book of Common Praiers, as alſo with the form of Ordination uſed in the Roman Church, as contained in their latter Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now if we ſhew, that our form of Ordination is more agreeable to that of the Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> then the form preſcribed in the Roman Pontifical, we ſhall prove that we ſtand for the moſt warrantable antiquity, and conſequently for right in this point. I will not diſpute now about thoſe called inferiour Orders in the Roman Church, both becauſe none will pretend them to be eſſential to Church Diſcipline, and the duties appropriated to them are performed in both Churches, ſometimes by perſons conſtituted in no order, and ſometimes by thoſe in ſacred Orders. I will therefore only treat of the three ſacred or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders propoſed by <hi>Suarez,</hi> out of <hi>Optatus Milevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53284:50"/>as neceſſary to the conſtitution of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Hierarchy, to wit Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons.</p>
               <p>And beginning with Deacons, the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in the fourth chapter hath only theſe words, <hi>Diaconus cum ordinatur, ſolus Epiſcopus, qui eum benedicit, manum ſuper caput illius ponat, quia non ad ſacerdotium ſed ad miniſterium conſecratur.</hi> 
                  <q>When a Deacon is ordained, only the Biſhop, who bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth or ordaineth him, is to lay his hand on his Head, becauſe he is not ordained to Prieſthood but to miniſtery.</q> Here we have three things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the Miniſter, the matter, the order: the Miniſter is only the Biſhop: the matter or the exteriour ſign, is the impoſition of hands: the form is not deſcribed in particular, but is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word <hi>benedicit:</hi> for to bleſs here is nothing elſe but to pronounce the words by which the power of this order is conferred to the Perſon ordained; all which is exactly performed in the Ordinationof Deacons by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as we have ſeen in the Chapter prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>Now touching the Ordination of Prieſts, the Council decrees thus, <hi>Presbyter cum ordinatur, Epiſcopo eum benedicente, &amp; manum ſuper caput illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us tenente, etiam omnes Preſbyteri qui praeſentes ſunt manus ſuas juxta manus Epiſcopi ſuper Caput illius teneant.</hi> When a Prieſt is ordained, the Biſhop bleſſing him and laying his hand on his Head, the Prieſts preſent are likewiſe to lay their hands on his Head together with the Biſhops hands. Of this decree likewiſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> is as obſervant, as the Roman is negligent:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53284:51"/>for in their preſent Pontifical above mentioned of <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, I ſee no mention made of what the Council decrees, that the Prieſts preſent ſhould lay their hands together with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops hands upon the Head of him that is to be Prieſted, and their practice goes accordingly. But in lieu of this ceremony decreed by the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> I find many others ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the foreſaid Pontifical of which the Council makes no mention, ſuch as thoſe about the amict, albe, girdle, maniple, ſtole, cope, candles, croſſes, oil, and the like. And which is more remarkable, the Council makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that great and chief ceremony uſed in the Roman Church and appointed in the aforeſaid Pon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ifical, and wherein ſome of their Authors will have the very eſſence of Prieſtly ordination to conſiſt, as we have ſeen above out of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> that the Biſhop is to deliver to the perſon to be Prieſted, after having anointed his hands with holy Oil, the Chalice with wine and water, and the Patin over it with the hoaſt or wafer, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Accipe poteſtatem offerre Sacrificium Deo, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſque celebrare tam pro vivis, quam per defunctis,</hi> Receive power to offer ſacrifice unto God, and to celebrate Maſs for the living and the dead. If this ceremony were ſo eſſential, or the power of ſacrificing were ſo inherent to Prieſtly ordination, as the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will have it to be, certainly that grave and venerable Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> would not have paſſed it over with ſo deep a ſilence, when it deſcended to particularize the duties and performances of inferiour Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters not ſo neceſſary as thoſe of Prieſts, as may
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53284:51"/>be ſeen in the enſuing Chapters of that Council from the fifth chapter forward.</p>
               <p>Finally touching the Ordination of Biſhops, the aforeſaid Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> has theſe words, <hi>Epiſcopus cum ordinatur, duo Epiſcopi ponant &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neant Evangeliorum Codicem ſuper Caput &amp; cervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem ejus, &amp; uno ſuper eum fundente benedictionem, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqui omnes Epiſcopi qui adſunt manibus ſuis Caput ejus tangant.</hi> 
                  <q>When a Biſhop is ordained, let two Biſhops put and hold the Book of the Goſpels over his head and neck, and one bleſſing him, let all the other Biſhops that are there preſent touch his Head with their hands.</q> Here three things are required, the giving or placeing of the Book, the impoſition of hands, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be given, whereof the placeing of the Book is no eſſential part, as
<note n="*" place="bottom">Vaſquez in 3. p. diſp. 240. w. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>Vaſquez</hi> declares, and ſo both Churches deviate ſomthing from the form mentioned: for if we are to believe <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez,</hi> and the Pontifical he quotes, the Book of the Goſpel is put upon the ſhoulders of the Biſhop conſecrated, not by the Biſhops conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating, but by one of the Chaplains; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates out of Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> that anciently it was performed by the Deacons, who are no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of this Order. Neither do I find by Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> that the Pontifical he ſaw, do's contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſaies; yet I find it otherwiſe, in the Roman Pontifical forementioned of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the Eighth, to be ſeen in the Library of <hi>Dublin</hi> Univerſity; where it is ordered, that the Biſhop conſecrating, together with the Biſhops
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53284:52"/>aſſiſting to help him, do place the Book over the neck and the ſhoulders of the Biſhop conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without ſaying any word, one of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains of the Biſhop elect kneeling behind him, and holding the Book, until it be given to his hands; and then the Biſhop conſecrating, and the other Biſhops aſſiſting him, do touch with both their hands the head of the Biſhop elect, ſaying, <hi>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum,</hi> Receive the Holy Ghoſt. And in ſuppoſition that the mode of placeing the Book is not eſſential to this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, certainly the form preſcribed by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this particular is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and appoſite to the purpoſe of this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Arch-Bishop, or other Bishop conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, delivering the Bible to the Bishop conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, ſaying, <hi>give heed unto reading, exhortation and Doctrine,</hi> with other wholeſome admonitions touching his paſtoral duty.</p>
               <p>Now touching the eſſential parts of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which do conſiſt in the impoſition of hands as matter, and the benediction, or words pronounced by the Bishop conſecrating, as form, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is exact in obſerving the form preſcrib'd by the foreſaid Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> ſince it orders, that all the Bishops preſent should lay their hands upon the Bishop elect, and only the Arch-Bishop or Bishop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating, should bleſs or pronounce the words of the form, ſaying, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt for the office and work of a Biſhop in the Church of God now committed unto thee, by the impoſition of our hands, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt.</hi> Here the Roman
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53284:52"/>Pontifical deviates from the foreſaid form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> ordering, that both the Bishop conſecrating and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops aſſiſting should pronounce the words of the form, ſaying, <hi>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we ſee, how exact the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> is, in obſerving all the eſſential and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary parts and ceremonies preſcrib'd, by that renowned Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> for the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bishops, Prieſts, and Deacons. As for other ceremonies not eſſential, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf declares, that even in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacraments (whereof they will have Orders to be a part) they may be altered by the Church, as the condition of matters, times and places may require. Neither is this to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Church Univerſal, congregated in a general Council only, but alſo of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church; whence proceeded the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Rites, in things indifferent, amongſt the ancient, and even modern Chriſtians of ſeveral places and orders, approved by that grave ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of

               <p>AS the Church of <hi>England</hi> did not think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to follow that of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all their ſuperfluous ceremonies, eſpecially ſuch of them as are noxious, and oppoſite to the ſincerity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian diſcipline; ſo it do's not grudg to go along and conform with them, in what they retain of ancient integrity.</p>
               <p>In many things we agree with them. Firſt, that only Bishops are to give Orders. Secondly, that none be promoted to Orders without the title of a benefice, or ſufficient patrimony (which is far more exactly obſerved in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> then in the Romish Church.) Thirdly, that the perſons to be Ordained be examined as to behaviour and ability. Fourthly, that certain times and daies are appointed for Ordination. Fifthly, that the perſons to be ordained, ought to appear in the Church. Sixthly, that they receive their Orders on their knees. Seventhly, that they receive the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53284:54"/>Communion. All this is commonly obſerv'd in both Churches (but more exactly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly in the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) as to Orders in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>Now as to particular Orders; we agree in the following points, as to Deacons. Firſt, that the Arch-Deacon preſents them to the Bishop. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Bishop enquires of the Arch-Deacon, whether he knows them to be worthy of that Order. Thirdly, that the Bishop admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes the Congregation, that if any perſon has any thing to ſay againſt them, he should declare it. Fourthly, that the Biſhop inſtructs them in the duty they are to perform. Fifthly, that lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are ſaid, and the Biſhop exhorts the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to pray for the Perſons to be ordained, that they may be fit Miniſters in that ſacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Sixthy, that the Biſhop gives them the Book of the Goſpels, and power to read them in the Church of God. Seventhly, that one of the Deacons newly ordained ſhould read the Goſpel. Herein we agree. But we differ from the Roman Church. Firſt, where they add to the litanies the invocation of Saints and Angels. Secondly, where power is given to the Deacons to read the Goſpels for the dead. Thirdly, that what is not expreſly delivered by the Roman formula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is more clearly expreſſed by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> As for example, the Order of Deacons in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is given by theſe words, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt for power to reſiſt the Devil and his temtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Name of the Lord,</hi> which being too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and common to all Chriſtians, is made more proper and appoſite to the function of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53284:54"/>by theſe other words uſed in the Engliſh ordinal, <hi>Receive autority to exerciſe the work of a Deacon in the Church of God committed to thee, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Fourthly, that we red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As to the order of Prieſthood, agreeing with them in the eſſential parts of the matter and form, and ſome indifferent ceremonies, we differ from them. Firſt, that a Prieſt with them is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with Oil. Secondly, that power is given him to offer a proper ſacrifice, and really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory, as well for the dead as for the living, of all which no mention is made in the aforeſaid Council of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Thirdly, that with them only the Biſhop laies his hand on the head of the Prieſt to be ordained; but with us all the Prieſts preſent do lay their hands upon his head together with the Biſhops hands, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the expreſs order of the Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally touching the Ordination of Biſhops, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with them in the eſſential parts of matter and form, belonging to that Order, and in ſome accidentaly ceremonies, as before declared, we diſagree with them in ſome conſiderable ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures. Firſt, that in both Churches a mandate is required for receiving this order; but in the Romiſh from the Pope, in the Engliſh from the King. Secondly, in both Churches an Oath is required, which in the Romiſh is in favour of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53284:55"/>Pope, in the Engliſh in favour of the King. Thirdly, in both Churches an examen is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd; and tho the Romiſh pretends to follow the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> herein, yet they inſert their decretal Epiſtles and obedience to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made in that Council. Fourthly, they uſe an heap of veſtments and ceremonies, of which neither the Apoſtles, nor primitive Church ever had notice, which are too tedious to relate, and more to practice. Finally and chiefly they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a new Symbol or Creed, coined in the Council of Trent, to be profeſſed by him that is to be ordained Biſhop, containing among other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, obedience to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> articles never mentioned by the Apoſtles, nor by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Creeds, nor by the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> nor by any of the four firſt general Councils.</p>
               <p>Now Reader conſider, how rude and raſh are the cries of the vulgar Romiſh writers and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers againſt our Orders, as invalid for not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming with the whole heap of their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, tho in the ſubſtantial and eſſential parts we agree. For beſides the intrinſic falſity of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, it brings a manifeſt ruine and nullity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their own Orders; ſince both we and they ſuppoſe, that inferiour Orders may not be given, but by the Biſhops, and Biſhops may not be made but by other true and lawful Biſhops. Then if the whole bulk of ceremonies &amp; requiſites pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the preſent Roman <hi>Pontifical</hi> (of <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> above mentioned) be neceſſary for a valid Ordination of a Biſhop, it follows evidently, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53284:55"/>there is no lawful Biſhop, and conſequently no lawful Prieſt, or Deacon at preſent in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This conſequence, I prove thus: no Biſhop was Ordained after the rites, ceremonies &amp; requiſites (above mentioned in the Roman Pontifica) for 300 and more years in the ancient Roman Church; then if the aforeſaid ſtock of ceremonies and requiſites be eſſential to a valid Ordination, no lawful Bishop was made all that while in that Church; &amp; it being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as is ſuppoſed before, that Bishops muſt be made by other lawful Bishops, it follows evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that all the train of Bishops or Men ſo called by the Roman Church in after ages, were no true Bishops, and conſequently no Prieſts, or Deacons made by them, were true Prieſts, or Deacons.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus</hi> the ſeventh; who living but a few daies, by the ſame means <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourteenth was choſen into his place, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued but ten Months; after whom by the ſame voices entred <hi>Innocentius</hi> the ninth who held the Papacy but two Months: at laſt was choſen <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the eighth by the ſame voices; who by the permiſſion of God continued this intruſion and uſurpation for thirteen years. Now that none of theſe were, nor could be true Popes, is thus demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>Unto the election of all theſe concurr'd the voices of thoſe Cardinals created by <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth, whereupon it followeth inevitably that all thoſe elections are plain nullities, ſince by the conſtitution of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the conclave in the election of <hi>Popes,</hi> the power of chuſing the <hi>Pope</hi> is granted only to the Colledg of Cardinals, which is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of true and lawful Cardinals: but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals who made all thoſe elections were no true Cardinals, being made by <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth who was no true <hi>Pope,</hi> and therefore had no place nor power to make them, therefore the aforeſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of Popes from <hi>Sixtus,</hi> being made by no true Cardinals, were no elections, but abſolute nullities in the Law to all intents and purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Now that ſuch titular Cardinals as were created by him that is no true <hi>Pope</hi> are no true Cardinals, and conſequently can give no voice, nor make
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53284:62"/>any lawful or good election is evident by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al precedents of former times in the Roman Church. Such is the caſe of <hi>Benedict</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, who ſitting at <hi>Avignion</hi> created divers Cardinals; but for as much as he was judged no true <hi>Pope,</hi> but an Anti-Pope, and an uſurper, therefore all by him created were no Cardinals, and ſo were held and reputed till their dying day. And when after the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the fifth, he that was called <hi>John</hi> the 23. in the time of that long and miſerable Schiſm, intruded himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully into the Papacy at <hi>Bononia,</hi> where he then was Legate, and ſo being <hi>Pope</hi> created di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Cardinals, they were all reputed and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be no true Cardinals in the Council of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and a new and true <hi>Pope</hi> was then cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, named <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, not by the ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals (becauſe they had no power) but by the whole Council.

                  </gap> be ſaid to be made by all, without contradiction of any Man while the reſt I ſay, was expected to come in, there came into the Chappel Cardinal <hi>Geſualdus</hi> and <hi>Sſortia</hi> (the former whereof was Dean of the Colledg of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals) and by a crafty and wicked device, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the election in truth and in law already made. <hi>Geſualdus</hi> cries out, my Lord's, let us number the voices, to ſee if two full parts have conſented; whereupon he began to count, not haſting to make an end, but leiſurely proceeding with intermiſſions and delaies, which he did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to a crafty end, that Cardinal Saint <hi>Sfortia</hi> might have time alſo to act his part, which he fail'd not to do: for in that mean time he got two of the Cardinals out of the Chappel who had given their voices, and carried them into another place called <hi>Sala Regia;</hi> and leaving them there he returned to the reſt, and largely laies open to them, the rigour and ſeverity of <hi>San Severino</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:53284:63"/>(for they fear'd his juſtice, he being a juſt and upright Man) and hereupon the greater part of them moſt perfidiouſly got them out of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and aſſembling together with the reſt made a new election of Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandine,</hi> who was called <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth; and this is the truth of that buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Now that the former election of <hi>San Severine</hi> was good and effectual in law, is a cleer caſe: for the voices that choſe him were for number com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and ſufficient, when they pronounced him for <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſet him in the chair. And as for the ceremonious ſolemnity uſed in the elections, that all the Cardinals ſitting in their order together with him that is to be choſen, every one in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall ſay, I ſuch a one chuſe ſuch a one to be <hi>Pope;</hi> and that the Secretary of the Conclave ſhall take the ſcrutiny, and write down every ones voice; it is not an eſſential part of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or neceſſarily, or eſſentially required to make an election: for the expreſs words of the Text do declare, define and peremtorily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him to be <hi>Pope</hi> inſtantly, as ſoon as he is choſen and received by two parts of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; and he is then by the Law ſaid to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and received of the Cardinals, when they take him and convey him to the Chappel afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, and make him ſit down in the <hi>Popes</hi> ſeat; and he is ſaid to be choſen or elected, when the ſaid two parts declare their conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him to be <hi>Pope.</hi> Now all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in and upon the Cardinal <hi>San Severine;</hi> &amp; when the election is thus don by public &amp; open denunciation, there needs no Scrutineers to take
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53284:64"/>the voices, as is clear by the law. And this is one way of chuſing the <hi>Pope,</hi> and is called the way of aſſumtion, whereof mention is made in the foreſaid Bull of <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, and by this way which is as ſufficient and effectual in law as the other, was Cardinal <hi>San Severine</hi> choſen; and wanted nothing required by the law to the eſſence of a true election, but only ſome formalities, which by the law are not neceſſary. Nor is it material to ſay, he wanted inthroniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ordination, or kiſſing of his foot, for all theſe are but effects and conſequences of a true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; and are appointed to be don to him that is elected, but do not help forward his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the election is properly held don and perfected before they be performed; as any man may ſee in the aforeſaid Bull of <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Neither is the calling together of all the Cardinals neceſſarily required; for it is expreſly commanded in no law, and as for the text of the Canon law, called <hi>licet devitanda;</hi> it ſhews the validity of the election, as is ſoundly proved by Cardinal <hi>Jacobatius,</hi> who ſhews, that at leaſt a Council is to be called, to declare whether the election be good or no; and that they may not proceed to the election of another.

The words of the Councils decree are theſe. <hi>By this definitive ſentence of the great and univerſal Holy Council, which is here recorded in writing, for all the World to know, and all poſterity to take notice of, the Council pronounceth, decreeth, and declareth,</hi> Gabriel <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called</hi> P.

               </p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the fifth was guilty of Simony, and deſerves to be treated as <hi>Eugenius</hi> in the Council of <hi>Baſil;</hi> our Author declares in the foreſaid treatiſe chapter the 2. from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond number, by the words following. <q>In the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53284:66"/>Datary, which is an office at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein all matters of benefices and buſineſſes of that kind are expedited, this is the courſe and cuſtome at this day. It is duly obſerved, that the benefices belonging to the <hi>Popes</hi> collation, whether reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to his gift, it falling void in the moneth that belongs to the Papacy, which in regard of their far diſtance from <hi>Rome,</hi> or that they are with cure, cannot be given to his Nephew <hi>Borgheſius,</hi> are given to ſome of the Suitors or competitors, that are of that Country, or next adjoining to it. For they take order, that none be beſtowed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but ly vacant for a time; that ſo a whole concourſe of competitors may flock together for it: which is not don for any good end, that ſo they might know the difference of the ſuitors, and give it to the worthieſt, as by the decree of the Council of Trent they are bound to do: but that they may learn which is the richeſt, and ſo may know how to make the beſt bargain. To this end, the time of this competition is appointed at a certain day, whereof public notice is given, that ſo all the ſuitors may come, and that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the datary may learn in that time which of all that ſeek it, are beſt able to buy out and extinguiſh the penſion that is laid upon that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. For this is the faſhion now in uſe; the <hi>Pope</hi> chargeth every living in his gift with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more or leſs: ordinarily it amounts to half of the whole value of the benefice; if but a third part, 'tis held eaſy and favourable; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it extends to two parts of the whole divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three: which don, he provides by an other ordination, that by preſent payment of five
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53284:67"/>years profit, the penſion ſhall be exringuiſhed. Now when by this concourſe and compariſon of competitors, they have found which of them is beſt able to buy it, on him preſently it's conferr'd, &amp; ſo not the worthieſt but the wealthieſt carries it: and thus are all the Popes livings beſtow'd at <hi>Rome.</hi> Now he that comes thus to a benefice, by paying down five years penſion before hand, buyes it full dear; for he paies for it at the rate of 30. in the 100. over and beſides his perſonal ſervice. For the clearing of this point; Suppoſe a benefice worth 300 Crowns a year: this is ſure to be charged, being ſo great a Living, with a penſion of the largeſt ſize, namely ſome 200; that ſo one 100 may be left to the Incumbent; he then that comes to it in this manner, pays down a 1000 Crowns for the penſion, and an 100 more for writing, and ſeal of his Bulls, and for expedition; and ſo all laid together, he buys his living of 300 at the rate of 30. for the hundred, beſides his perſonal ſervice and cure of Souls.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Moreover whereas in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> certain Simoniacal tricks and devices called <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſus</hi> &amp; <hi>expectatives,</hi> are flatly forbidden; the <hi>Pope,</hi> to delude the Councils decree, grants coadjutorſhips, with aſſurance of future ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion after his Death to whom he is made co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor; but makes them pay one years profit for the expediting and diſpatch of their Bulls. Now theſe coadjutorſhips are the very ſame, and tend to the very ſame end, even to bring in by hook and crook ſums of mony: for by theſe penſions, and buying out of penſions,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53284:67"/>this <hi>Pope</hi> has ſcraped up twenty hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Scutes, all which he has beſtowed in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lands for his Nephew. He bought of <hi>Sarelly</hi> a goodly large territory called <hi>Rignanum,</hi> near unto <hi>Rome,</hi> at the price of 353000 Scutes. The City of <hi>Sulmona</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> he bought of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and gave for the ſame the ſumm of 150000 Scutes.</p>
                  <p>He purchaſed thoſe goodly demains, called the four <hi>Caſalia,</hi> within the territories of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which coſt no leſs then 700000 Scutes. In the mountanous Countries belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the City, which are commonly at ſix in the hundred, he made a purchaſe that ſtood him in 400000 Scutes.</p>
                  <p>He has built a palace, and called it after his own name the palace of <hi>Burgheſius;</hi> upon the Fabric whereof he has beſtowed 300000.</p>
                  <p>He has ſo enriched the Cardinal <hi>Burgheſius</hi> his Nephew in private Stock and wealth, that his very moveables are eſteemed worth 600000 Scutes.</p>
                  <p>Good God? what a mighty wealth is here? and I appeal to any that knows the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> if this could be got together by any means into the <hi>Popes</hi> own Coffers and private purſe, but only out of that office of the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces called the Datary. Therefore this one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration is preſumtion ſufficient enough, to prove his foul and deteſtable Simony; ſeeing it is certain, that the whole name and bloud of the <hi>Burgheſies</hi> were but of a mean eſtate, nay many of them are known to have run out of their livings, and to be little better then bankrupt, when this man got the Popedom.</p>

Hitherto the words of the foreſaid Author, who promiſed to juſtify all that he had ſaid to be true out of the Authentical Books, Records, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings extant in <hi>Rome:</hi> and that out of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the <hi>Popes</hi> Bulls it ſhall appear, to whom each benefice has been given, and with what penſion they were charged. Of all which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation can give a large teſtimony: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them dealing in buſineſſes of benefices at <hi>Rome,</hi> have tranſacted them in this manner.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of all before ſaid is, that if Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal contracts do annul the election of a <hi>Pope;</hi> and the ſame crime committed after his election, depriveth him of all right to that place, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: if all Cardinals made by ſuch unlawful and criminal <hi>Popes,</hi> were no Cardinals; and <hi>Popes</hi> made by unlawful Cardinals are no <hi>Popes,</hi> as is eſtabliſhed by the Laws and Canons foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; if all thoſe nullities of Simonies, frauds and cheats have intervened in the election of <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and following <hi>Popes,</hi> as hitherto recorded, and no care has bin taken of repairing thoſe nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as is manifeſt, but rather the like practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces continued to this day; as is well known to thoſe that are acquainted with that Court; all this being ſo, it followeth as a forceable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that there is not in the See of <hi>Rome</hi> any true <hi>Pope,</hi> nor has bin ſince <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteen.</p>
               <p>How ſtrange will all the precedent narrative appear to many poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Roman Catholics, who are not permitted to know more then their beads, and ſome ſmall prayer Book, with the litanies of the conception, of Saint <hi>Joſeph, Sancta Thereſa, &amp;c.</hi> and a liſt of great indulgences
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53284:68"/>for very ſmall devotions? But ſuch as know by ſight or faithfull relation, the intrigues of <hi>Rome</hi> (whereof my good friend <hi>N. N.</hi> who gave me the occaſion of this diſcourſe, is one) will eaſily perceive, that all which is ſaid, is very ſuitable to the language and practice of that Court.</p>
               <p>Now, therefore, let the poor Souls conſider by theſe particulars, what mettal that Roman holineſs is, which they ſo blindly adore. And let their bold and preſumtuous inſtructors for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to cenſure the Ordinations of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in which no ſuch dirty practices did ever intervene, when their prime See is defaced and diſgraced with ſuch public and peremtory exceptions againſt the uſurpers of it: and let them ceaſe boaſting as they do, of a wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, reordaining ſuch as were ordained in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if they chance to paſs to their communion, whereas it is not leſs ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unlawful to reordain perſons already lawfully ordained, then to rebaptize ſuch as were lawfully baptized, according to <hi>Gregory</hi> the great his declaration:

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of the large extent of Chriſtian Religion profeſſed in the Church of</hi> England.</head>
               <p>THe fourth and chief kind of univerſality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>Suarez,</hi> as neceſſary to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Catholic Church, is the extent of it over all the parts of the Earth. This he denies to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as not paſſing (ſaies he) the Limits of the Brittiſh Dominions. But if he ſpeaks of the Faith profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as he ought to do for the preſent purpoſe) he was greatly miſtaken. Here I will ſhew, that King <hi>James</hi>'s ſaying (as <hi>Suarez</hi> relates) that the one half of the Chriſtian World do join with us in the ſame Faith, did not exceed the bounds of truth and modeſty; and that of three parts of Chriſtians, two do join with us in the profeſſion of the Faith of Chriſt contained in the Apoſtles Creed; tho not of all contained in the Creed of <hi>Trent,</hi> whereby the Roman Church alone is ſingled from us, and from all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches: not unlike <hi>Iſmael,</hi> whoſe hand was againſt every one, and every Mans hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. And as the Donatiſts would confine the Church of God to that corner of <hi>Africa</hi> they inhabited; ſo the Romaniſts would not have it extended further then their juriſdiction; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53284:70"/>for excommunicated and damned, all that join not with them in obedience to their <hi>Pope.</hi> That they may be aſhamed, or weary of their blind preſumtion and cruelty, in offering to mangle and deface in this manner the Church of God (if avarice and ambition, the genuine cauſe of this proceeding, is capable of ſhame or amendment) I will give to the People blinded by them a view of the multitude of illuſtrious Nations and Religious Believers in Chriſt, which they do raſhly if not maliciouſly condemn, and ſegregate from their communion.</p>
               <p>And beginning with Proteſtants inhabiting <hi>Europe,</hi> from the remoteſt parts thereof Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in the Kingdom of <hi>Polonia,</hi> containing under its dominion <hi>Polonia, Lituania, Podolia, Ruſſia</hi> the leſs, <hi>Volhinia, Maſſovia, Livonia, Pruſſia,</hi> all which united in a roundiſh encloſure are in circuit about 2600 miles, and of no leſs ſpace then <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> laid together. In this ſo large a Kingdom, the Proteſtants in great numbers are diffuſed through all the quarters thereof, having in every Province their public Churches and Congregations, orderly ſevered and bounded with Dioceſes, whence they ſend ſome of their chiefeſt men of worth unto their general Synods, which they have frequently held with great cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity, and with ſuch prudence and piety, as may be a happy example to be followed by all Chriſtian Churches; and likely would be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a due conſideration, if the inſatiable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice and boundleſs ambition of <hi>Rome,</hi> aſpiring deſperatly to a monarchical power over all, did not obſtruct all the waies, that ſincere piety and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53284:70"/>zeal of Religion can imagine for the peace of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>For as much as there are diverſe ſorts of theſe Polonic Proteſtants, ſome embracing the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſian or the Bohemic, others the Auguſtan, and ſome the Helvetian confeſſion, and ſo do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſome outward circumſtances of diſcipline and ceremony; yet knowing well, that a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom divided cannot ſtand, and that the one God, whom all of them worſhip in Spirit, is the God of peace and concord, they jointly meet at one general Synod: and their firſt act alwaies, is a religious and ſolemn profeſſion of their unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conſent in the ſubſtantial points of Chriſtian Faith neceſſary to Salvation. Thus in general Synods at <hi>Lendomire, Cracovia, Petricove, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave, Torun,</hi> they declared upon the Boheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic, and Helvetic and Auguſtan confeſſions ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally received amongſt them, that they agree in the general heads of Faith, touching the Holy Scripture, the ſacred Trinity, the perſon of the Son of God, God and Man; the providence of God, Sin, free will, the Law, the Goſpel, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Chriſt, Faith in his name, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, the Catholic Church, and ſupreme head thereof, Chriſt; the Sacraments, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and uſe, the ſtate of Souls after Death, the Reſurrection, and life Eternal.</p>
               <p>They decreed, that whereas in the forenamed confeſſions there is ſome difference in phraſes and forms of Speech concerning Chriſts preſence in his holy Supper, which might breed diſſention, all diſputations touching the manner of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhould be cut off, ſeeing all of them do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53284:71"/>the preſence it ſelf; and that the Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Elements are not naked and emty ſigns, but do truly perform to the Faithful receiver, that which they ſignify and repreſent. To prevent fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture occaſions of violating this ſacred conſent, they ordained, that no man ſhould be called to the ſacred Miniſtry, without ſubſcription there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and when any perſon ſhall be excluded by excommunication from the Congregation of one confeſſion, that he ſhall not be receiv'd by them of another. Laſtly, For as much as they accord in the ſubſtantial verity of Chriſtian Doctrine, they profeſs themſelves content to tolerate diverſity of ceremonies, according to the diverſe practice of their particular Churches, and to remove the leaſt ſuſpicion of rebelling &amp; ſedition wherewith their malicious and calumniating adverſaries might blemiſh the Goſpel: tho they are ſubject to many grievous preſſures, yet they earneſtly exhort one another to follow that worthy and Chriſtian admonition of <hi>Lactantius: defendenda Religio eſt non occidendo, ſed moriendo; non ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitiâ, ſed patientiâ; non ſcelere, ſed ſide: illa e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim bonorum, haec malorum ſunt.</hi>

Now coming to <hi>Germany,</hi> the whole Empire conſiſteth of three orders or ſtates; the Princes Eccleſiaſtical, the temporal Princes, and the free Cities.

And what the multitudes of Subjects are profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame Faith with theſe Princes, we may gueſs by the ampleneſs of Dominions under the government of the chief of them, ſuch as are the Prince Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenburg, Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe, Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Brunſwic, Holſt, Lunenburg, Meckleburg, Pomeran, Swyburg.</hi> Among whom the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> hath for his Dominion not only the <hi>Marquiſat</hi> it ſelf, containing in circuit about 320 miles, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with 50 Cities, and about 60 other walled Towns; but likewiſe a part of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Prignitz,</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Croſſen,</hi> the Seigneuries of <hi>Sternberg</hi> and <hi>Corbus,</hi> and lately the three Dukedoms of <hi>Cleve, Dulic</hi> and <hi>Berg,</hi> of which the two former have either of them in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit 130 miles.

               <p>When the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth reduced the City of <hi>Ghent</hi> from a revolt, one of his Peers counſelled him he ſhould raſe down to the ground that great City.

What power will they have need of, to ſubdue the reſt of Chriſtianity, alien from their communion, ſo far exceeding themſelves in number and forces, as above declared? And in caſe they ſhould ſubdue them; what fire and ſword would ſuffice to deſtroy them? And if all ſhould attend their wiſhes; what heart could endure to ſee ſuch multitudes of their dear Countrymen, friends and neareſt relations pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, whether temporally, by their decrees, tending to the ruine of all Chriſtians, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to their power; or eternally, by the cruel verdict of Eternal damnation, they give againſt all diſſentors?</p>
               <p>I know ſome of them will ſay, that this ſevere ſentence is not of their making, but delivered by Chriſt, againſt all that will not obey his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car upon Earth, the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And poſſible it is, that ſome of the ſimpler ſort may believe it is ſo. But its long ſince I knew and proved, that none ſufficiently converſant in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their own Theology, could ſeriouſly think it to be ſo: but that according to their principles, its blaſphemy and Hereſy, to ſay without reſtriction, and in general terms, (as commonly they do) that none may be ſaved out of the communion of the Roman Church.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53284:84"/>And my Antagoniſt <hi>I.S.</hi> tells us, I did not treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs therein againſt truth of Doctrine, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt policy or prudence, as he calls it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I put a great ſtop to the converſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, if People did think, that out of the Romiſh Communion any may be ſaved. So as the prudence demanded from me, was to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion my Doctrine to the increaſe of the <hi>Popes</hi> Dominion, be it with truth or untruth; and pronounce ſentence of damnation againſt all Chriſtians, not ſubject to him, tho I ſhould know no ſuch ſentence to be againſt them in the judgment of God.</p>
               <p>I wiſh my good Brethren of the Roman Church did reflect upon, and acknowledg, the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury they do to themſelves, in breeding and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting this unchriſtian hoſtility, with the whole Society of Chriſtians ſeparated from their communion, ſo numerous and illuſtrious, as we have ſeen in the preceeding Chapters; imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hatred towards all, in the hearts of their Children, which forceably muſt beget a return of hatred, or diſaffection and miſtruſt. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious its, to create to themſelves ſo many Enemies; how uneaſie and diſadvantagious, to bereave themſelves of the free and amiable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, of ſo many noble Nations and brave People, which the apprehenſion of Hereſy makes intractable to them?</p>
               <p>What happened to me with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> young Man that came in my company out of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> makes me more ſenſible of the miſery that Romaniſts bring upon themſelves this way. He was of his own diſpoſition, chearfull and

I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of him the cauſe of that alteration; he anſwered, that he looked upon all thoſe men as Heretics, which made their very ſight odious to him, and their company diſpleaſing. The man did not well know, what Hereſy was; and much leſs did he know, whether thoſe Men he ſaw were Heretics or no. He acknowledged them to be good men, juſt and civil in their dealing, and adorned with noble gifts of God; yet the prejudice he was in againſt them, by conceiving them to be Heretics, made their ſight and company odious to him. Would not this Man have been more happy in conceiving a better opinion of the People? would it not make him live with more eaſe and comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them? not to mention now that higher Emolument and duty, of maintaining charity towards all Men.</p>

N.</hi> againſt me, is a ſuppoſition, that I have left the Catholic Church and Faith, by withdrawing from the communion of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and embracing this of <hi>England.</hi> In the whole diſcourſe of this Treatiſe, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety Catholic; and the Faith profeſſed in it truly Catholic and Apoſtolic; and all this by rules and principles taken from the ableſt of Romiſh Writers, for proceeding in this inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: whereby it remains proved, that all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of <hi>N. N.</hi> againſt me, went upon a falſe ſuppoſition, and conſequently are vain and groundleſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:53284:86"/>
Hence I infer, firſt, how vain is his query, and more vain his divining anſwer, about what drew me out of Gods houſe. It appears by what is ſaid hitherto, and will be further declared in the reſt of this Book; that in my change, I did not leave the houſe of God, but removed to the beſt and ſoundeſt part of it; that no private ſpirit, or raſh fancy moved me; but a ſincere acknowledgment of truth, by the ordinary means God has diſpoſed for us to come by it.</p>
               <p>I infer ſecondly, how groundleſs and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable his pretention is, that I ſhould have quitted the holy Doctors, <hi>Gregory, Ambroſe, Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> and all the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Catholic Doctors. He do's not tell how or wherein I have deſerted that noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; neither indeed were it eaſy for him to tell it. I live, and do firmly reſolve to dy in the ſame Catholic Church, which they lived and died in; and in the profeſſion of the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic and Apoſtolic Faith, which they profeſſed. The ſame, and no other Faith is profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> whoſe communion I have embraced, as hath bin ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated hitherto; and I hope by the merits and grace of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to enjoy the company of thoſe bleſſed Saints in Heaven, maugreall the cenſures of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was I ever cloſer with thoſe Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Romiſh Church, then I am now in the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> It is one of the perverſe calumnies of our adverſaries, to give forth, that there is not due regard had of them here. I ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. I have obſerved diligently the waies of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53284:86"/>the Univerſities, and method of Study with Learned men in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> and I ſee with them far greater application to the ſtudy and reading of holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church, then ever I ſaw amongſt Romaniſts. Whilſt the moſt learned of theſe ſpend their life and forces in ſpeculative notions, only ſerving Schole debates, learned Proteſtants employ their time more happily, in the ſtudy of the Holy Scriptures, of Fathers, and credible Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>I infer thirdly, how raſh and injurious is his cenſure, in ſaying, that by embracing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, contained in the 39. Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have made my ſelf parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all the Hereſies, and an aſſociate of all the Heretics, that were from the beginning of the World to this day. Of theſe he makes a great liſt, beginning with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> whom he will have to be the firſt Heretic before Mans Creation, and from him proceeds to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech,</hi> the <hi>Gyants,</hi> all thoſe that entred not into the Ark, but periſhed in the deluge, who were all Heretics, ſaies he. Then enters <hi>Cham,</hi> with the builders of <hi>Babels, Eſau, Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres, Corah</hi> and <hi>Dathan, Nadah</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bihu,</hi> all thoſe ſtrange Kings that made war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> all the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Baal.</hi> Of all theſe Heretics, he ſaies, I am become an aſſociate, by embracing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion contained in the 39 Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But is not all this rage without any mixture of reaſon? Is it not a ſufficient confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53284:87"/>of the Man, and a foul confuſion to him, to repete this raving ſpeech of his? In what part of the 39 Articles, or of the three Creeds we uſe in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will he find thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies he appropriats to us?</p>
               <p>But he will come nearer home, and make a long narrative of errors and vices related of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Melanchton,</hi> and others, who contributed with their writings to the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church. To which I ſay, firſt, that I have but too much reaſon not to believe all that they ſay of their oppoſers. Secondly, that tho ſome of thoſe, who concurred to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſhould have fallen as men, into ſome vices or errors; the Reformation it ſelf (which certainly was a work of God) ought not to be undervalued for that. The ſacred Colledg of the Apoſtles, firſt founders of the Chriſtian Church, had in it one as bad as <hi>Judas;</hi> ſhall the whole Colledg of the Apoſtles, and the Religion founded by them be diſeſteemed for that? Several of thoſe renowned Fathers, preachers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the Goſpel after the Apoſtles in the primitive Church, as <hi>Origen, Tertullian,</hi> &amp;c. through human frailty, were guilty of no few er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; ſhall we therefore deſpiſe the work they did, and the healthful part of their Doctrine? If you did tell me of ſome Doctrine impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as an article of belief, and rule of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that were Heretical, or oppoſit to the law of God, that were pertinent to work upon me: but this I am certain you will never be able to do; and no leſs certain am I, that your Church is guilty of ſuch impoſitions upon its
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53284:87"/>followers; as I ſhall demonſtrate by ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the ſecond part of this treatiſe. But to tell me of vices and errors of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is both impertinent, and imprudent, I knowing ſo much how matters go on your ſide. I appeal to your own knowledg by what you have ſeen and heard of of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if you will conceal your knowledg herein: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelf, and the Reader, not to Proteſtant Hiſtorians, which happily you may ſuſpect, but to your own moſt qualified, as <hi>Platina, Onuphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and even <hi>Baronius.</hi> Read in them the acts and lives of ſeveral of thoſe your holy Fathers, and infallible oracles of Doctrine, the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſee the tranſactions of <hi>John</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth about the year 966, or of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cound, about the year 999. or <hi>John</hi> the 18. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1003. or <hi>Benedict</hi> the 9. about the year 1033. or of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. about the year 1080. or <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. about the year 1294. or <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6. and of his outragious Son <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Borgia,</hi> about the year 1294. and you ſhall find them to be ſuch men, as no <hi>Epicurean</hi> mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſtoried out to the World, has outgon them in ſenſuality, cruelty, tyranny, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vices. And while I have in my memory, and before mine eies unfeigned Hiſtories of this kind; ſpare heaping fables againſt ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons concurring to the reformation.</p>
               <p>But who will not admire the mans diſingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in reproaching me, and the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> with the Tenets, or madneſs of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, which he relates at the end of the 16 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Book; knowing and confeſſing in the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53284:88"/>ſame place, that they are reproved and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Church; and that the author of them <hi>James Naylour</hi> was condemned to a perpetual impriſonment, after being whipt publicly, and his tongue bored with a burning iron. May not I, with the ſame reaſon, reproach him and his Church, with the horrid impieties of the Jews, Moors, and Atheiſts, as thick ſet in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as Quakers among us? But were that fair dealing, I knowing that ſuch Sects are not approved of, but rather puniſhed in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries? Why then for ſhame, will <hi>N. N.</hi> tell me, I am become of the ſociety of Quakers, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he telling at the ſame time how ſeverely they are puniſhed amongſt us? And if I were of his temper, for pleaſuring vulgar readers, with ſtories and rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this kind, I could with more ground of truth, and therefore more ſenſibly return upon him a large ſum of practices, which to indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgments would appear no better then madneſs; yet daily uſed by perſons and ſocieties approved and applauded in his Church. But I reſerve my time and labour for a more ſerious and becoming work: in the mean time I remit him to Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> his Book, containing a Survey of the Weſtern Church; where he ſhall ſee ſet down, with candor and ingenuity becoming a Gentleman and a Chriſtian, the rites and cuſtoms he ſaw practiſed in ſeveral ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of the Roman Church. He do's not grudg to praiſe them, where he finds them praiſe worthy, neither do's he ſoure his pen in relating their faults. If you will be ingenuous, you will
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53284:88"/>confeſs he ſaies nothing but what you know your ſelf to be in practiſe; and if long cuſtom and paſſion got by it has not blinded your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you ſhall perceive many of thoſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be as unreaſonable and mad, as any of thoſe you relate of the Quakers. And if you will have a more exact and vigorous diſcuſſion of this point, go to Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> his Book, where he ſpeaks of the fanaticiſm practiced in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and you ſhall find in it confuſion enough, and reaſon to ſpare objecting to us the follies of Quakers.</p>
               <p>And whereas you pretend to fright me with repreſenting to me errors of particular perſons of the Proteſtant Church; if I would reſolve to make a return to you of that kind, I could make my Book ſwell, and the Readers heart tremble, by relating the Hereſies, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and execrable Doctrines, which I have heard preached, and ſaw printed by perſons of your Church. I will only relate to you, for example, ſome few propoſitions of Books that came to my own hands: the one was of a grave preacher, who prepared for the print a large volume of Commentaries upon the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> This book was ſent by the Provincial of his order, to be examined by me: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read it with attention, I voted againſt the printing of it, for ſeveral faults I ſpecified in my cenſure, but eſpecially for containing ſome deſperat blaſphemous propoſitions, as <hi>this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, touching St.</hi> John Evangeliſt. <hi>Joannis Excellentia titulo dilecti maxima eſt: major eſt quam Redemtoris etiam in deo. Tanta eſt, quanta
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53284:89"/>eſſe Deum trinum &amp; unum; imo propter hoc verbum caro factum eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the underſtanding of which mad piece of Rhetoric, it is to be conſidered, that there are two Sects of Nuns; the one paſſionatly bent to extol St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt above St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt; the other preferring, with no leſs animoſity, the Baptiſt before the Evangeliſt. Our preacher before mentioned to pleaſure the Nuns of the Evangeliſt, delivers that prodigious <hi>Paradox;</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> may be turned thus, <hi>exceeding great is the excellency of</hi> John, <hi>upon the account of being the Beloved. It is greater then that of a Redeemer even in God: it is ſo great, as to be God in trinity and unity: nay for this cauſe, the word was made fleſh.</hi> Go now and compare this piece of Doctrine with any of thoſe you related of the Proteſtant writers; and if it has not out gon them all, add to it what follows.</p>
               <p>Being advertiſed by the inquiſitor general of <hi>Spain,</hi> at the ſecond time he ſent me a licence for reading prohibited Books, that I had not given him account of what cenſureable propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions I might have lighted upon in my readings, as he had charged me to do, in the inſtrument of ſuch a Licence, which he had ſent me the year before; I ſent to him a liſt of ſome perverſe Doctrines I ſaw in Books approved, and in much uſe among themſelves (for Proteſtant Books I could find none to give account of) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which were the three propoſitions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prefixed for titles to ſo many moral diſcourſes of Leander de <hi>Murcia</hi> in his Commentaries on <hi>the book</hi> of Eſther. <hi>The firſt of which goes thus,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53284:89"/>Adeo eſſicax eſt mortis memoria ad reducendos in meliorem frugem homines, ut non ſolum ipſi, ſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Deus op. Max. propoſita ante oculos morte in meliora contendat.</hi> 
                  <q>The memory of Death is ſo powerful to reduce Men unto a better life; that not only they, but even God Almighty himſelf laying death before his eies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes better. The ſecond runs thus, <hi>Etiam dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon morte ante oculos conſtituta contendit in melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> even the Devil looking upon death, mends himſelf.</q> The third propoſition is this, <hi>Tanta dilectione proſecutus est filius Dei homines, vt pro ipſis quaſi inſanire videatur.</hi> 
                  <q>The Son of God his love to men has bin ſo great, that he ſeems to be mad for them.</q> And if thus it goes, even in Books current and approved among you, what if I did relate the Doctrines of others cenſured and prohibited by your inquiſitions; as you and your party frequently do upbraid our Church, with erroneous Doctrines of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men, which we do utterly deteſt, and our learned Men do vigorouſly oppoſe by word and pen, in Pulpits, Books, and Scholes?</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>The Reformation of the Church of</hi> England <hi>vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ſlanderous aſperſions of</hi> N. N. <hi>and other Romaniſts.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is very uſual with the Zelots of the Romiſh Church to make <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight ſole Author of the Reformation of the Engliſh Church, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Prince with bitter invectives and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious reports, thereby to render the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contemtible, to which <hi>N. N.</hi> in the 14. chapter of his Book adds a ſlanderous relation of the lives and behaviour of ſome Monks and Friers come out of <hi>Germany,</hi> which he pretends to have bin the authors and contrivers of the 39. Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I will not repete the many idle ſtories he tells of them, more fit to divertiſe ſimple perſons of his own credulity in a Winter night at the fire, then to work on ſerious and knowing Men. I have choſen for a more ſhort and ſolid way, rather to juſtify our cauſe, with poſitive arguments, then to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our adverſaries in ſifting fopperies.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe I will lay for foundation of my preſent diſcourſe, that the whole frame of the Reformation ſtandeth upon two points: whereof the firſt, and more reſented at <hi>Rome,</hi> is the denying of the <hi>Popes</hi> ſupremacy, and the withdrawing of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53284:90"/>ſubjection to him. The ſecond is the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Liturgy and Doctrine of the ſaid Church from errors and corruptions introduced in it.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt it is clear and evident, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. nor <hi>Luther,</hi> nor <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor any of thoſe ſtrangers mentioned by <hi>N. N.</hi> were authors or cauſers of the freedom of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from ſubjection to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> This freedom being by its own right inherent in it from the beginning of its Chriſtianity, however King <hi>Henry</hi> his valour and reſolution broke off effectually the Tyrannical uſurpations of <hi>Rome,</hi> which long time did oppreſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church and Nation, notwithſtanding their continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, and complaint againſt thoſe Romiſh extortions.</p>
               <p>Far were thoſe good Chriſtians that inhabited <hi>England</hi> before the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, from giving or owning obedience to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſo when <hi>Auguſtin</hi> came hither, about the year 590, and demanded their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Bangor</hi> returned him anſwer,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Concil. Spelm. P. 108.</note> 
                  <hi>That they were obedient to the Church of God, to the</hi> Pope <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to every godly Chriſtian; to love every one in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in charity, to help them in word and deed, to be the Children of God: and other obedience then this, they did not know due to him, whom he named to be</hi> Pope, <hi>nor to be Father of Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if <hi>Auguſtin</hi> did pretend to ſuch a ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>Popes</hi> of it now would have, certainly he exceeded his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53284:91"/>commiſſion for St. <hi>Gregory</hi> that ſent him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to that ſupremacy which his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors do aſpire to, as we shall demonſtrate in the 15 chapter of the ſecond part of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; and how far he was from pretending <hi>England</hi> to be of his juriſdiction, may appear by what is related of him, that being told, certain children were <hi>de Britannica Inſula,</hi> he did not know whether the Country were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or Pagan.</p>

               <p>True it is, That ſeveral of our Godly Kings did permit appeals ſhould be made to <hi>Rome,</hi> in matters wherein our own Biſhops could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and directions to be ſought from thence, as from a flourishing and learned Church, not as a ſuperior Judicature.

The Emperors did employ their Biſhops and Divines, in reſolving upon wholſome decrees touching Church affaires, and theſe decrees they eſpouſed themſelves for Laws; ſo as the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of them ſhould be ſubject to penalties.

But the arts of <hi>Rome</hi> are too much known in <hi>England,</hi> for the people to be further deluded by them.</p>
               <p>And therefore a National Synod, or a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, and other Clergy of the Kingdom being celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>My adverſary <hi>N. N.</hi> after highly inveighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Articles, and boaſting to diſcover Hereſies in them, ſingles out the 22. Article which runs thus, <hi>The Roman Doctrine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Indulgences, veneration and adoration as well of Images as of reliques, as alſo of the invocation of Saints is abſurd and vainly invented, nor is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon any authority of Scripture, but is rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the word of God.</hi> Upon which Article, <hi>N. N.</hi> delivers this heavy cenſure, <hi>that it is falſe, profane, and Heretical.</hi> But in the whole diſcourſe of the ſecond part of this Treatiſe, I will demonſtrate God willing, that it is rather true, Religious, and Catholic; as alſo I do intend by the help of God, to vindicate the reſt of thoſe Articles in a ſeparat Treatiſe from the cavils of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander White</hi> and other Romaniſts, whereby <hi>N. N.</hi> will find how much he is miſtaken in taking the ſaid <hi>Alexander White's</hi> Book againſt the thirty nine Articles for unanſwerable, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is far miſtaken in ſaying reſolutely, tho without having any ground for it, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>White</hi> hath beſtowed more time and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration in quitting thoſe Articles, then I have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53284:96"/>don in deſerting the communion of the Roman Church. Seven years he ſaies Mr. <hi>White</hi> ſpent in deliberating upon his reſolution; but certainly I have ſpent many more years in deliberating upon mine. How many they were as it is not eaſie to demonſtrate, ſo it is not material to tell; men may deliberate long and err at laſt in their reſolution. To my reaſons alledged for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution which I took I appeal, and do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſe them to public view and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that others as well as I, may judg of the weight of them.</p>
               <p>Very foul and ſlanderous alſo has bin the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of our adverſary, in ſaying that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of our 39.

How falſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is, may appear by the public Records and Hiſtories of the Land, and by ſeveral Acts of Parliament paſſed with great deliberation of all the States of the Kingdom upon the ſettlement of the Reformation, and of thoſe Articles as well in that great Synod or Convocation celebrated under <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth in the year 1552. above mentioned, as alſo an other no leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Synod held at <hi>London</hi> ten years after, viz. 1562. wherein the ſaid Articles were reviewed, examined, and confirmed.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen among <hi>Seldens</hi> Books kept in the Bodleian Library of <hi>Oxford,</hi> an Authentic CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of theſe Articles printed at <hi>London</hi> in the year 1563, and a ſcroul of parchment annexed

               <p>THo <hi>N.

He alledges teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Fathers, and miracles in favour of it: and pretends it to have bin a Doctrine of more ancient ſtanding then the Lateran Council. To all which I have given a full anſwer in what I have delivered by my diſcourſe formerly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in what will follow in the ſecond part of this Treatiſe from the 18.

               <p>Only I will reflect here upon two or three very groſs miſtakes of <hi>N. N.</hi> in his preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with me upon the point. The firſt is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my belief of this great myſtery. He ſaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely (without giving any ground for his ſaying, as indeed he could have none for it) that I do not believe Chriſt to be really preſent at all in this Sacrament, <hi>why then</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>ſhould he diſpute with us about the Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, ſeeing he flatly denies the body and blood of Chriſt to be really and ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament?</hi> But good Sir, where have you ſeen
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53284:97"/>this flat denial of mine. certainly not in my decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (which ſeems to be the object of your quarrel) not in the 39.

                  </gap>g? To call thoſe miracles they pretend to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene in the conſecrated bread <hi>Monſtrous,</hi> he takes it for a contempt of Gods wonders in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. So if I ſay, a Man born with 2 Heads and 3 Eies is a Monſtrous Man; that muſt be taken for an affront put upon all humane kind.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53284:99"/>Sir I reverence Gods wonders, and thoſe many miracles wrought by his powerful hand, and I bleſs his holy name for all. But thoſe miracles you would have us believe to happen in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the Euchariſt; as that the ſubſtance of the bread vaniſhes a way, and the accidents of it remain without any ſubſtance to reſt upon, &amp;c. theſe I deny to be true miracles, or works of God, but a product of your erring imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if you will perſiſt in calling them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, certainly they muſt appear monſtrous ones. For the proof whereof, you give your ſelf a very conſiderable help, by a definition, or deſcription of a miracle, which you produce out of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> how much to your purpoſt is not eaſie to find; but very clearly it ſerves for my preſent purpoſe, of making your pretended miracles in the Euchariſt appear moſt properly monſtrous. You tell us that <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaies,
<note n="*" place="bottom">1. P. quaes. 105. A. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>quod nomen miraculi ab admiratione ſumitur: Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio autem conſurgit, cum effectus ſunt manifeſti à cauſa occulta.</hi> 
                  <q>That the word miracle comes from admiration: and this admiration doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, when the effect appears, and the cauſe is hidden.</q> Here we have the common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary nature of a miracle deſcribed; that a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effect ſhould appear, tho the cauſe ſhould be hidden. Now it reſts to know what is the proper notion of a Monſter. Philoſophers do give us this definition of it out of <hi>Ariſtotle, monſtrum est effectus à recta &amp; ſolita ſecundum ſpeciem diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitione degenerans.</hi> 
                  <q>A Monſter is an effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating from the right and common diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53284:99"/>of things of that kind.</q> So that a Man born with two Heads is called monſtrous, becauſe he degenerats from the right and common diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other men. The Colledg of

Now then, if the common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary nature of a miracle is, as you tell us out of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that the miraculous effect ſhould be manifeſt and apparent, tho the cauſe were hidden; then a miracle degenerating from this common courſe and nature of miracles, ſo as the effect pretended to be miraculous ſhould not be manifeſt or known to any, muſt be according to theſe rules a monſtrous Miracle, deviating and degenerating from the common courſe of true Miracles. Of this kind are your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miracles of the Euchariſt; that the bread and wine ſhould be ſubſtantially converted into the fleſh and blood of our Saviour corporally preſent. If this were ſo indeed, and therefore a real and true Miracle; this miraculous effect would appear to the ſenſes of men, as that true and miraculous converſion of the Water into Wine, at the wedding in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Calilee,</hi> did appear to the ſenſes of the Men preſent there; and thereby appeared to be a true Miracle, and more fit to breed a belief in the beholders; which is the ordinary aim of Divine providence in working Miracles; and which certainly Chriſt would not have obtained of the perſons then preſent, if he had only told them, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remaining with the ſame color, taſt and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53284:100"/>ſmell which it had before, was really converted into Wine, without letting any of their ſenſes bear teſtimony of ſuch a converſion. Of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kind are your imaginary Miracles, which being of your own making, I may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to God, or prejudice to his true Miracles, call them <hi>Monſtrous,</hi> as degenerating from the common courſe of true Miracles.</p>
               <p>The third miſtake that I am to put <hi>N. N.</hi> in mind of at preſent, is, concerning his pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to affinity with the Greek and Ruthenian Church, in the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and of other points controverted, with our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches; for which he pleaſes himſelf, in telling us of a favourable relation to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, given by a <hi>Muskovite</hi> Prieſt to a <hi>French</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that feaſted him. But that he may ſee how wide is his miſtake herein, and how far the Grecians and Ruthenians are from joining iſſue with the Roman Church againſt us, I remit him to what I have related above upon more ſolid and authorized grounds in the 13.

                  </gap>ce to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater Book deſigned againſt me; yet I have ſo little a ſhare of this preface directed to me, as I hope the diſcreet Reader will excuſe me if I be not ſo large in diſcuſſing it as ſome may expect. Truly the matter and ſtyle of it is of that nature, as made me ambiguous for a time in reſolving upon any reply to it. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more conſideration I conceived it my duty to make the reflexions following upon it.</p>
               <p>After having beſtowed ſome few Pages in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning a ſuppoſed fall of mine from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Faith, he falls ſuddenly to lament the ſufferings of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and to accuſe the ſuppoſed authors of it. As to the firſt I have endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give ſatisfaction in the whole diſcourſe of this Treatiſe: if he has true charity for me, he will be glad to find, that I am not in that bad condition he ſuppoſed. And if he will be ingenuous, and has not reſolved (as 'tis uſual with them) to ſhut his eies againſt all eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that may let him ſee his errors, or entertain
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53284:101"/>a charitable thought of his Chriſtian Neighbors, he may ſee cleerly by what I have ſaid hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that by embracing the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have not forſaken the true Catholic Faith and Church; that I am far from being guilty of the Hereſies, or aſſociate of thoſe Heretics he mentions.</p>
               <p>Now as to the ſecond, touching the miſeries of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> I heartily condole with him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but cannot approve of his manner of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, nor of ſome Doctrines he lets fall by the way. I think it to be a more Chriſtian duty, and more becoming a good Paſtor, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort people in affliction to a conformity with Gods Holy will, and to an acknowledgment of their ſins that drew his anger upon them, with due repentance of them; then to excuſe their errors, and thereby to encourage them to provoke divine juſtice to further ſeverities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. The former I have don on all occaſions: the ſecond I ſee you do in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of your Book which I am to examine now.</p>
               <p>I will not debate with you touching the matters of fact you handle, who begun, or were more faulty in thoſe unhappy revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I do not envy you the occaſion you had of greater knowledg in that part then I, who departed the Country in my younger age two years before thoſe Tragedies begun, and never returned until ſome years after our Soveraigns happy Reſtauration. I leave to others better furniſhed with notices, to examine what you ſay that way; But I may judg of the ſtyle and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53284:102"/>Doctrinal part of your Book, grounding my judgment (as I hope I ſhall do) upon good reaſons. And firſt as touching the ſtyle, I am probably perſwaded, that no ſober or wiſe man even of the party you pretend to favour, will approve of the harſh and contemtuous language wher with you ſpeak of perſons of great honor and quality, eſpecially of one of the great Peers of the Realm, an Earle and ſon to one of the greateſt Earles of this Monarchy, Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of that <hi>fair and goodly Province of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> ſo ſtiled by your ſelf, not to mention his perſonal talents, apt to make even one of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er birth noble, and to gain him reſpect. All theſe titles &amp; Honorable qualities, could not induce you, to give him once any of thoſe civilities and marks of reſpect, that are due to perſons of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and quality. And what is yet more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, not contented to abuſe his perſon, you extend your contemtuous Language to his whole family, linked by manifold ties of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity with the moſt illuſtrious families of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                  <hi>N. N.</hi> ſeems to pretend to a ſhare in this vaſt Superiority of the Pope over princes. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to a ſeat of Judicature, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces a ſevere ſentence againſt our gracious Soveraign, his own natural Prince, That he has not bin juſt and impartial in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his favors to his Subjects, applying to his Majeſty that old verſe, <hi>Non erat Rex Jupiter omnibus idem,</hi> That he was not the ſame King to all, That all being guilty in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as he ſuppoſes for this complaint) he extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Roial bounty to one party more then to the other. In which ſuppoſition <hi>N. N.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers both the guilt of his judgment, and the defence of our King. If all were guilty, all loſt their right to the Roial favours, all forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their poſſeſſions. Then all was at the will and mercy of his Majeſty to confer upon thoſe he thought fit: why will you pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of his liberty herein? May not his Majeſty return upon you thoſe words of the Lord of the Vineyard ſpoken to the envious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers,
<note n="b" place="bottom">Mat. 20.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? is thine eie evil becauſe I am good?</hi>

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:53284:103"/>
But this is not the only defence his Majeſty hath againſt your raſh judgment. It is very manifeſt, that his Majeſty has ſhewed the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of a loving Father to all his Subjects, as well in <hi>Ireland</hi> as in all the reſt of his Dominions, and did procure by all the means poſſible to him the comfort and ſatisfaction of all, as may conſiſt with right and Juſtice. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for ordering the affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he hath erected in <hi>Dublin</hi> a Court of Claimes, place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein Juſtices, whom I have heard the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves commend for men of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble integrity and conſtancy, in delivering their judgment according to the right without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of perſons. Such as could prove their Innocency in this Court, had the benefit of it, who were many; and very many more, who would not go through that trial, had the benefit of the Kings gracious pardon, and Roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bounty in reſtoring them to their Eſtates and Poſſeſſions. I have heard from a perſon of great Honour and truth, and of great knowledg in the matter, that of the lands, which by rigor of Law were declared to be forfeited to the King, his Majeſty has beſtowed already more then the one half upon thoſe that loſt them. Neither are the ſtreams of his Roial Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy put to a ſtop, but ever flowing graces and favours upon deſerving perſons, on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons poſſible; tho when the pretenders are ſo numerous, it is impoſſible to content all, and not eaſy for ſtanders far off, to judg which of the ſeveral pretenders to the ſame thing, ought to be preferred. Men are apt to ſpeak eagerly,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53284:104"/>and conceive ſtrongly for their own intereſt; ſelf love will ſuggeſt arguments for that ſide, and ſuppreſs all that favour the contrary. It is for the King, that God has placed on high, to ſee equally, and accordingly to judg of both ſides.</p>
               <p>You plead vigorouſly for the neceſſity of a ſupream Judg in ſpiritual matters, to whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory judgment all muſt ſtand; to reſiſt it, or call it in queſtion, muſt be taken for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in religion, for Hereſy or Schiſm; if ſuch a judg were wanting, ſay you, there would be no end of controverſies in religion. How far your pretention goes that way, and how well grounded, will be ſeen in the ſecond part of this Book, now to our preſent purpoſe briefly. Will not you acknowledg in a proportionable pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the like neceſſity of a ſupream Judg, for civil debates in each Kingdom or State, to whoſe final judgment the parties muſt ſtand? other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there will be no end of quarrels, no peace among neighbours.

But ſuch autority as Subjects ought to reverence, and ſtand to his decretory ſentence without further appeal, I can prove out of Gods words, that a King has it in his Dominions, ſo as without breach of Loialty and tranſgreſſion of Gods will and command, a Subject may not reſiſt the judgment of his King, nor call it further in queſtion; much leſs may he pronounce a judgment againſt it. See all decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Heavenly Preacher, <hi>Eccleſiastes</hi> 8.4.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53284:104"/>in theſe words, <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power, and who may ſay unto him what doſt thou.</hi> Certainly its no act of Loialty to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his actions don with accord and public Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as in the caſe in hand. It is a commenced Rebellion. The firſt Rebellion of men upon Earth, that of our firſt Fathers againſt God in Paradiſe, whoſe contriver was the Devil, began with ſuch a queſtion; The helliſh Serpent began his conſpiracy with <hi>Eve,</hi> calling in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Law and Government of their Prince and Maſter: <hi>cur praeceptit vobis Deus, ut non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ederetis ex omni ligno paradiſi?</hi> Why hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den? Thus did the firſt Rebellion of man againſt God begin, queſtioning his decree. Queſtions againſt Laws eſtabliſhed by a lawful Prince, thus deriving their Progeny from the Devil, ſhould be for that very reaſon abhorred by Chriſtians. And the rather, if we conſider how deſtructive they muſt be to peace and human Society, as overthrowing the very nature and intrinſic Conſtitution of a Magiſtracy, ordained principally to decide quarrels, and put an end to debates, by a Legal Sentence, which if not obeied, but expoſed to further inquiry and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the parties, is fruitleſs; and debates will be endleſs.</p>

And ſo I found it, he delivering upon the preſent Subject theſe three concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Firſt, <hi>that it is a mortal ſin to make war against any kind of Enemies without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Prince.</hi> And he adds this to be the common opinion of all: and it is to be noted, that he ſpeaks even in caſe the war ſhould be againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> His Second concluſion is, <hi>that Soldiers plundering or burning Towns by their own private autority, are obliged to repair the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage they have don.</hi> The Third concluſion of <hi>Bannes</hi> goes thus, <hi>ſuch as fight in a war made without the autority of the Prince, are obliged to make a reſtitution for all the dammages that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from ſuch a war to their own Republic or Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if ſuch as make a war even againſt <hi>Turks,</hi> (as <hi>Bannes</hi> ſaieth and proveth) without the authority of their Prince, do ſin mortally, and are obliged to a reſtitution for all the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages don to friends and foes, thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that bloody war in <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects, what account will they give to God
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53284:106"/>for the deſtruction of ſo many thouſands of men, women, and children on both ſides, the devaſtation of that ſair Land, and the burning and deſolation of ſo many goodly towns and houſes? Let the counſellors of that blind and furious war, (no leſs damnable then the actors,) reflect upon the heavy judgment that hangs over them for it, and let <hi>N. N.</hi> conſider bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what he writes: let him not be ſo eaſily wrought upon by hot headed and ſhallow brain'd informers, to deliver in public as a Doctrine of Divines, what the Divines he names do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and deteſt, as all men of ſenſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt needs do. For certainly to ſay, that Subjects may go to war without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their Prince, let who will ſay it, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerſe and ſeditious Doctrine, deſtructive to Loialty and public peace, a fierce error often practiſed in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the great dammage of it, and which therefore ought to be reprehended ſharply, rather then renewed or countenanced by good teachers.</p>
               <p>But our Antagoniſt tells us he ſpeaks of a defenſive war, and brings a heap of Teſtimonies to prove ſuch a war to be lawful, and to declare how far it may extend. But the main point is, what he ſuppoſes, without giving a ſufficient proof of it, that the Engagement of the party he pleads for, was only defenſive. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were the firſt aggreſſors, <hi>but this objection,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>is eaſily anſwered, as thus. It is a common Doctrine of the Divines, that it is lawful to prevent an evil that cannot be otherwiſe avoided then by preventing it.</hi> E. G. I.

What bloody deſigns were thoſe he ſpeaks of? how far diſcovered? how near at hand to be executed? If he knew it, why does he not declare it, being the very foundation of his defence, and preciſely neceſſary to make his allegations appear pertinent? What Piſtols were laied to the breaſt of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the North, what Canons were charged, what armies were marching againſt them, ſo as without killing thoſe that lived peaceably about them, they could not ſave their own lives? Yet if they were not in ſuch a ſtreight as this, the Teſtimonies you alledg of Divines are miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by you, and come very ſhort of proving what you pretend, as appears by the example you relate of one cocking his Piſtol to ſhoot at you, and to prevent him you ſhoot firſt at him.</p>

I have heard of ſome report ſpread among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> of a deſign of a Maſſacre upon them, and that this report was repreſented to the ſtate by ſome Lords of the Pale about <hi>Dublin,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to aſſiſt at the Council, to conſult with them, concerning the ſtate wherein the Kingdom was then, and the ſafety of it, they anſwered, that having received advertiſement, that a member of the Council had uttered at the Council board ſome ſpeeches tending to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute upon thoſe of their religion a general <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre,</hi> they could not wait on their Lordſhips, but rather muſt ſtand upon their guard till they were ſecured from perills. Thus I find it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a credible
<note n="*" place="bottom">Sanderſon <hi>in the Hiſtory of King</hi> Charles <hi>the firſt ad ann. 1641. Pag. 451.</hi>
                  </note> Hiſtorian of thoſe times, who adds, that to this Letter written by thoſe Lords to the Council of the 7. of <hi>December</hi> 1641. The ſtate gave anſwer by Proclamation, with all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Lords, to remove all miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and cleer the member of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil aſperſed from any ſuch pretended ſpeeches, or any intention thereto, and pray the Lords to attend the board on the 17. day after. But all this it ſeem was not ſufficient to cleer them from their apprehenſion of danger.</p>
               <p>Now if this paſſed ſo indeed, to ſay that a meer apprehenſion of danger from our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour without any certainty of it, is a ſufficient warrant to make war againſt him, if it be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, or kill him if he be a Particular (as our Antagoniſt ſeems to pretend) is a Doctrine of dreadful conſequences both to Societies and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53284:107"/>particular perſons? It is but too much experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced how raſh and heady a thing the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men is; how ready are falſe reports to fly; and if an apprehenſion or report without certain ground be taken for a ſufficient cauſe to kill a Man, or to wage war, who can have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his life, or how long ſhall peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et laſt among us?</p>
               <p>In this diſcourſe I do not intend to favour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the parties mention'd in that debate hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>N. N.</hi> I profeſs not to be a competent judg of thoſe quarrels, I only attend the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrines I ſee aſſumed to maintain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of one ſide, with intention to rebuke the ſame as univerſally falſe and deſtructive to the public peace and quiet. Neither in truth can I underſtand which of both parties may fear more prejudice from the Doctrine I am repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending. I ſee complaints and jealouſies upon both ſides, which of both hath more reaſon for it, as I am not apt to determine, ſo I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>N. N.</hi> (as alſo any other) may be uncertain to which of the parties he do's prepare ruine, by allowing ſubjects upon ſuſpicion of danger from their fellow ſubjects, to go to war with them, without the conſent of their Prince. If both do complain and fear, why may not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, as well as the other fall upon his fellow ſubjects, when opportunity will aſſiſt him, in conformity with that Doctrine?</p>
               <p>Truly I cannot but wonder how any one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under a Prince or ſtate that hath ſeveral Kingdoms Provinces or Societies to govern, ſhould dare to publiſh ſo pernicious a Doctrine
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53284:108"/>as this I am reprehending. If thoſe of <hi>Navar</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> ſhould renew old quarrels, or ſtir up new ones, and run to war about them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of their common Prince, how long would the King of <hi>Spain</hi> be able to keep peace in his Dominions? If his Miniſters did take notice of this Doctrine, and the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, certainly they would have all Books containing it, baniſhed out of their territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>But all this is ſanctified with <hi>N. N.</hi> by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us that the war was for Religion: and ſince the law of God and nature do permit a Man to kill an other that pretends to take away his life; with the ſame or more reaſon, he may kill one that means to take away his Religion, which ought to be more precious and dear to him then his life. Good God, whether has the perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men arrived, to canonize Murders and the moſt barbarous cruelties with the ſacred name of Religion? This language came not from Heaven. Chriſt, nor any of his Apoſtles did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver teach it, the Church inſtructed by them did not practiſe it. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſets before us the maxims and practiſe of Chriſtians in thoſe times by theſe noble words, <hi>Defendenda Religio eſt non occidendo ſed moriendo, non ſaevitia ſed patientia, non ſcelere ſed fide.</hi> Religion is to be defended, not by killing but by dying for it, not by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty but by patience, not by miſchief but by Faith. Thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles; thus did the brave <hi>Theban</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion defend their Religion, tho able to defend
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53284:108"/>it with Sword (as is teſtified by <hi>Tertullian</hi>) if the Spirit and Doctrine of Chriſt then ſteering the Church had permitted it.</p>
               <p>A particular perſon to defend his life, ſay you, may kill by way of prevention an unjuſt aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor that pretends to take it from him; to this purpoſe you quote Divines and Civilians, and from thence) you infer two conſequences, the firſt, that likewiſe a community or ſociety may war againſt and deſtroy another ſociety, from whom it fears the like deſtruction; the ſecond conſequence is, that a private perſon or a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety may alſo by way of prevention ſet upon and kill another whom he ſuſpects doth intend to take his religion from him. You abuſe foully the Doctrine above mentioned of Divines and Civilians by miſapplying it; both your conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences do not only contain a perverſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine againſt right Divinity and Chriſtian diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as now declared, but alſo do treſpaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rules of Logic. The former becauſe it is not ſo eaſie to ſurpriſe a whole ſociety largely diſperſed, as it is to ſurpriſe one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Evidences requiſit to qualify a prudent fear, ſuch as may juſtify a preventing onſet, may not ſo eaſily be found againſt a ſociety: the threatning words or purpoſe of one particular or more in a ſociety, giveth not ſo much aſſurance of the purpoſe or intention of the whole ſociety, as the words of a particular may give of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Beſides the killing of one particular is not ſo criminal and hainous, nor ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to an oppreſſion of innocents, as the kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſtroying of a whole ſociety is: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53284:109"/>its no lawful conſequence, a particular perſon may killby way of prevention another that he fear will kill him, <hi>ergo,</hi> a ſociety or great party may likewiſe by way of prevention deſtroy another from whom it fears the like deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond conſequence above mentioned, that if one to defend his life may kill an other that pretends to take it from him, he may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe kill him or them, that intend to take his Religion from him, this conſequence alſo I ſay, beſides the perverſe Doctrine it contains, is a faulty piece of Logic: it is not ſo eaſy to take his Religion from a man as his corporal life. Your Religion may not be taken from you by a ſurpriſe, or when you are a ſleep, or againſt your will, as your corporal life may be. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame prevention cannot be neceſſary or lawful for the preſervation of both. Any that hath true Religion in him, due love to God, and a ſincere and ſerious deſire of his own happineſs, muſt take the loſs of his corporal life for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to be the greateſt gain he can make, it being the greateſt ſecurity he can have of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life and glory everlaſting for his Soul and body, as our Saviour hath declared. And is it not a deſirable exchange to leave a painful ſhort and wretched life, for a glorious bleſſed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting one? Much he hath in him of Earth, and little of Chriſtian Spirit, who would not wiſh to be diſſolved, if he were ſure to be after his diſſolution with Chriſt. The only reaſon that can juſtifie a fear to dy and part with this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life, is the uncertainty of what may be our doom in the other, and the hopes of ſecuring a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53284:109"/>good one by further living: but when a ſecurity is given to paſs by death to a life everlaſting (as Chriſt gives to ſuch as die for God and his holy Faith) what Chriſtian conſideration can juſtifie a fear to ſuch a death, ſo far as to kill thoſe that intend to bring us to it?</p>
               <p>Truly <hi>N. N.</hi> I have ſo much of kindneſs and true friendſhip left in me for you, as made me ſorry, and not a little troubled to ſee ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Doctrines as theſe, contain'd in your book. I took you for a Man better principled, and if I had perceived any ſuch errors in your converſation at the time of our acquaintance in <hi>Spain,</hi> I would have refuted them, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my diſlike to them, as freely as I do now. I am willing to imagine, that <hi>non ex tuo haec dicis,</hi> that it is not your own deliberate ſentiment, but impoſed upon you by ſome of thoſe fiery emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> who will not ſtick to go through ſtreams of blood to extend the Popes power, and their own earthly advantages with it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the color of Catholic Faith. But by what is ſaid hitherto, and will be further confirmed in the diſcourſe following, it will eaſily appear to the unbyaſſed Reader, that it is no want of true Catholic Faith in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor any true zeal for it in the Roman Court, makes them diſturb thus the peace of theſe Kingdoms, obſtinately endeavouring the ruine of them.</p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> be not quite given over to the Spirit of deluſion, they will look upon all bloody ſuggeſtions of this kind, as proceeding from him that was the firſt author of rebellion in Heaven, and upon earth, and a <hi>Murderer

               <p>SR. if the ſevere Decree of your Church prohibiting to the common ſort the reading of Controverſial writings, doth not comprehend you alſo, I hope you will beſtow an attentive reading upon this Book for our old friendſhips ſake, but more for the love of Truth: and if you have not made a firm inflexible reſolution of not yielding to any evidences, be they never ſo clear, that may juſtify the way I took, or diſcover the errors of that which you are in, I may expect that by reading this Treatiſe, you ſhall find that I am not in that deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by my change which you ſeem to imagin. That by it I have not forſaken the whole houſe of God, as you ſay, but removed to the ſoundeſt and ſafeſt part of it; that I have not deſerted the Society of the holy Fathers of the Church, nor am become an aſſociat of Heretics, having come to a Church where I find as much veneration and ſtudy of thoſe Fathers, and as much aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Hereſies you mention, as ever I ſaw among you.</p>
               <p>And if you read further the ſecond Part now to follow of this ſame Book, you ſhall find that I did not forſake the Communion of the Roman
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53284:111"/>Church without grave and urgent reaſons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing me to it. Thoſe reaſons I have laid open in my firſt Sermon preached at <hi>Dublin</hi> and printed; great labor and ſtudy hath bin emploied in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering them: yet if you bring indifference with you to read my reply to that anſwer, you ſhall find that my reaſons alledged do ſtill remain in their force, and that the errors I refuted are further diſcovered, and cleared by occaſion of the defence made of them. But if you reſolve either not to read my Book, or bring to the reading of it a firm purpoſe of not yielding to any reaſon that may oppoſe thoſe ſentiments you are prepoſſeſt with, then my labor is loſt as to you: but I hope not ſo as to others more rationally diſpoſed. The word of God is a grain of ſeed, and brings forth its fruit in time diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently according to the different diſpoſition of the ſubjects it meets with: but eſpecially I hope that my endeavors will avail me with God; in whoſe preſence I write with ſincerity what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be conformable to his holy Word &amp; Will, and with a conſtant deſire in all theſe ſcrutinies to ſatisfy my own conſcience prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of the righteouſneſs of the way I took, and to help others alſo to the knowledg of the ſame truth.</p>
               <p>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> was brought before King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> and the Governor of <hi>Judaea, Porcius Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> to give account of himſelf and his Religion, he gave it ſo full, that <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaid, <hi>almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian:</hi> To which the great Apoſtle replied, <hi>I would to God that not only thou, but all that hear me were ſuch as I am, except theſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53284:111"/>bonds,</hi> Act. XXVI. 29. If you read with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and attention, the account I give of my reſolution, and of the Religion I embraced, I am perſwaded (whatſoever your outward expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be) it will work upon your mind a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like that of <hi>Agrippa.</hi> And if you ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would have you do what I did in this point, I ſay freely (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſay to <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>) that I would to God that both you and your brethren did take the like reſolution; but that it may be with leſs difficulty and reluctancy then I had, and with leſs croſſes and dangers for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>You tell me I am old; and I have many reaſons to believe it by my long continued infirmity of body, but I remember the time, when you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me a young man, and your ſelf an old man: then I being now old, you muſt be very old; and therefore both of us ought to meaſure our reſolutions and doctrine with the rules of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the intereſt of Eternity, rather then with thoſe of earthly policy and temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, in which we can have but a little ſhare, and a ſhort enjoyment. How then come you to ſpeak to me of the loſs of Friends, and of infamy got by my change? If it hath bin for the beſt in the preſence of God, and I am certainly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it was, I have got by it the grace and favor of God, and given joy to his Angels; and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe is to be preferred before that of the earthly friends you ſpeak of. I am much afraid that the fear of temporal ſhame and dammages is too ſtrong with you, and many others of your party to keep you from following truth, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53284:112"/>from ſearching after it with due care: I found it to be ſo in my ſelf (I confeſs my weakneſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with ſorrow, humbly craving pardon of God for it.) The fear of ſhame and loſs among men, more then any ſuperior conſideration, made me ſtruggle along time againſt the inward callings of God from my former errors, and to uſe all means poſſible to ſilence the cries of conſcience; but the more I laboured and ſtudied to allay them, the more force they got; and when I ſaw clearly by a ſtrict inquiry, that they were indeed from God, I yielded to them, notwithſtanding my natural reluctancies, and the heap of ſhames, croſſes, and dangers which I ſaw in the way, <hi>looking upon Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs deſpiſing the ſhame,</hi> Heb. XII. 2.</p>
               <p>In the life and doctrine of Chriſt we ſhall find Leſſons of this kind, but never in the dictats of nature. How would you imagine it ſhould be a natural inclination, that a man in his declining Age, ſhould change a ſtate of quiet, honor, and plenty of all things neceſſary for humane life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another of troubles, croſſes, affronts, no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a competent lively-hood, and a certain and continual danger of loſing his life. This was my condition at my change of Religion, and I may better declare it to you then to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. You can remember in what degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, applauſe and commodity I was where you knew me, plentifully aſſiſted with all things neceſſary, without any care or trouble in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them. Of temporal bleſſings I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no more. Neither would I at any time,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53284:112"/>tho I had a choiſe of fortune given to me.</p>
               <p>To this condition I might at that time have returned with ſome ſpecial aſſurances of good reception, when I came over to the Proteſtant Church, without any bargain made or promiſe had of a livelyhood, relying ſolely upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, that is never wanting, to ſuch as truly confide in it; and with certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I was to ſuffer croſſes, calumnies, curſes, affronts, falſe teſtimonies and conſpiracies againſt my life and credit, of all which I found a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſtore as I expected: and you tell me that my change was a work of Nature not of grace, one of your very ill grounded aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I pray conſult the caſe with your own natural inclination, and be ingenuous. Do but imagine your ſelf a little while make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a change as I did, and undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it the like danger and dammages, (as probably you ſhould, if the caſe did poſſibly happen,) certain I am that your nature would repreſent to you ſuch horrors in the caſe, that if all the Angels in Heaven did come down furniſhed with the moſt divine reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to it, you would take them all for ſo many Devills, and their reaſons for abſolute Madneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus much I can tell you of your own nature: but what grace may work upon you, God the author of it only can tell: and whilſt you do not feel this motion upon you ſo ſtrong as to forſake errors (tho known) upon the hard terms now mentioned, I pray ſpare your ill grounded ſevere cenſures againſt others, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53284:113"/>God moves to undergo thoſe difficulties for the truths ſake. Moderate your inconſiderate Zeal, and if you will govern it well, read unpaſſionately what is written here, and is to follow in this Book, whereby you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how far miſtaken you are in many things about your ſelf and others. And whereas you acknowledg your ſelf to be neer the end of this mortal life (as a man of your age muſt needs be) leave to your Friends and Brethren that Legacy, which your good Saviour Jeſus left, and with repeated earneſtneſs commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Diſciples, ſaying

<note n="*" place="bottom">63. Page</note> that <hi>I know in my conſcience that the Proteſtant Sect doth place all happineſs, in the

I will declare to the glory of God, and edification of the Chriſtian people, miſerably deluded by ſuch Slaves of fury and lies, what I know in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be true, That in the Proteſtant Church I ſaw more practiſe of ſolid vertue, piety, and devotion, and of the fear of God, more apt means uſed to purchaſe thoſe vertues (both by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Church, and by the ordinances of our ſtate) then ever I ſaw among the Romaniſts.</p>
               <p>Since my coming to the Proteſtant Church, my conſtant habitation has bin in <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledg of <hi>Dublin,</hi> where I ſee more practiſe of ſobriety, devotion, and piety then ever I ſaw in a Colledg of ſo many young men on the Romiſh ſide. Three times a day they go all to prayers to the chappel at ſix in the morning, ten at noon, and four in the evening, with admirable reverence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; their Prayers, moſt grave and pious for all purpoſes, and for all ſorts of perſons, they ſay kneeling, the Pſalmes ſtanding, and the ſacred Lectures they hear ſitting reverently and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, with a reſpect due to the Leſſons uſed by them, ſacred indeed as taken out of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fountains of Living waters of the old and new Teſtament, not out of the broaken Ciſterns of Romantic Legends, all being read in a voice
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53284:117"/>audible, and language intelligible, and thereby ſutable to the edification and inſtruction of all the people preſent.</p>
               <p>The ſame order and ſtyle I ſee obſerved in the Palaces of Princes and Prelates, and in the houſes of Gentlemen and godly perſons, all the family being called to pray together in the Chappel or other decent room of the houſe, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner now declared. When I come to the Royal Caſtle or palace of <hi>Dublin,</hi> there I ſee the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> (to whom a judicious <hi>French</hi>

If I look upon the people flocking to their public Churches on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daies, the very ſilence and modeſty of their carriage in the ſtreets gives me a Teſtimony of their inward good diſpoſition: and when they are come to the Church, each one retires to his reſpective ſeat, all being decently ſevered to avoid confuſion and diſorders. Divine Office is performed in a moſt grave and decent manner, all fitted to the benefit and ſpiritual food of ſouls, ſo as if any Hymm or Pſalm be ſung, with more exquiſite muſic, the Chanter or ſome other of the Quire admoniſhes the people what Pſalm or verſe is to be ſung, that ſeeing it in their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53284:117"/>Books they may be furniſhed with the ſenſe, that thereby the muſic may work better on their minds to devotion; ſo great a care is taken, that in all we pay to God <hi>rationabile obſequium</hi> a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſervice with ſenſe and feeling of what we do.</p>
               <p>What if I conſider the admirable devotion and reverence wherewith they go to receive the ſacred Communion, far greater then ever I ſaw with Papiſts, tho pretending to believe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, (they know not themſelves what) about the preſence of our Saviour in that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, then Proteſtants do. A ſpectacle of this kind, certainly grateful to God and to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which I ſaw in Chriſts Church of <hi>Dublin</hi> on Reſurrection Sunday laſt year, ſticks faſt in my memory with joy. The moſt Reverend the Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> having performed the Communion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with ſingular decency and good order, he took himſelf firſt reverently the ſacred Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and gave it to the Miniſter of the Altar, then to the Lord Leiutenant, to the Peers and the Roial Council, and to a numerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, all receiving it with ſingular devotion, having for aſſociates in giving it the moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> Primate of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Right Reverend the Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> the chief of the Biſhops of <hi>Ireland,</hi> after the Metropolitans, and three dignitaries of the Church, Doctors in Divinity, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Cup, each one making a Godly brief exhortation to the receiver for a due receiving of it, the Lord Arch-Biſhop having read at
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53284:118"/>the Communion Table a grave and pious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, exhorting to a right preparation for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that venerable Sacrament, as is uſually don in all Churches, upon ſuch an occaſion.</p>
               <p>Go now Mr. <hi>I.

And as for me you have confirmed me in the eſteem of the election I made, and in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great mercy of God, in drawing me out of a Congregation where the ſpirit of fury and untruth animating all your Libel is countenanced. If we are to believe you (and ſhall we?) you had the boldneſs to preſent it to a moſt illuſtrious perſon, whom I forbear to name for very reverence, fearing an offence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in mentioning that ſo durty a piece of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhould be put into ſuch hands. You tell us moreover, that it was publiſhed by the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of your Superiors. If it be ſo, certainly <hi>God has turned the counſel of your Ahitophels into fooliſhneſs</hi> Let any man that hath not loſt his wits judg, whether it be tolerable that men, who profeſs to be poor and humble, ſhould ſpeak ſo ſcornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and contemtuouſly of ſo great and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53284:119"/>a part of Chriſtianity, as we have ſeen the Proteſtant Church to be? whether it be prudence in perſons complaining that they are perſecuted for their Religion, and under the laſh of a Proteſtant Government, to cock and inſult upon their maſters, with barbarous abuſive language, and moſt groſs and manifeſt calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? Mr. <hi>I. E.</hi> knows that in two viſits he was pleaſed to beſtow on me, after he had honor'd me with his famous Libel, excuſing the harſh Language of it, I told him my diſcontent was not for any injury don to me, but for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice I conceived ſuch undiſcreet writings would bring upon his poor Countrymen and mine of the Romiſh Communion, of whoſe wellfare I could not omit to be ſolicitous, and grieve for the harm they have received often by the means of blind Zelots.</p>
               <p>Truly I was much pleaſed with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he ſeemed to have of my temper very alien from ſpite or malice, and of the ſpirit of the Proteſtant Church, in coming ſo freely to me after ſuch heavy affronts publiſhed by him againſt both. I do admire and honor the ſingular patience and Chriſtian modeſty of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, in not being to ſevere as Romaniſts are (where they can command) in puniſhing ſuch proceedings, and if Mr. <hi>I. E.</hi> and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were wiſe, they ſhould rather honour, then abuſe this modeſty of their Maſters.</p>
               <p>When I conſider the different procedure of the Proteſtant Church, and of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> with their deſertors, I am ſtrongly confirmed in the choiſe I made. If any perſon departs from the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53284:119"/>Proteſtant Church to the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> they neither curſe nor rail, nor plot againſt his life or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: they onely commiſerate his fall, and pray for him, that God may convert him. Herein appears the ſpirit of Chriſt, his meekneſs and charity. But when any comes from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church to the Proteſtant, he may be ſure to have curſes, calumnies, affronts, conſpiracies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his life and repute follow him while he lives. A ſtrong point of policy, apt indeed, to terrify weak minds, that they dare not deſert their quarrell; but a policy dictated not by that <hi>wiſdom that is from above, peaceable, gentle, full of mercy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. but from that other called by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>earthly ſenſual, deviliſh.</hi> v. 15.

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>An Anatomy of Mr.</hi> I. S. <hi>his Genius and drifts, appearing in his dedicatory Epiſtle to my Lord Lieutenant of</hi> Ireland.</head>
               <p>THE diſſections of Anatomy diſcover imperfections and diſeaſes in the vitals, and other exterior parts of the body, which a fair skin or cunning dreſs hides from the eies of a common beholder. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a Scholaſtic examen will lay open the faults and corruptions both in the eſſential and ornamental parts of a diſcourſe, which upon a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient view appear plauſible and commendable. Unto a mind clouded with paſſion and prejudice, and the favour of an eſpouſed, or the diſlikes of an adverſe party, the writing of Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53284:122"/>may appear without blemiſh or fault; but an inciſion being made, the flesh and the skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off, it will be found void of truth in the propoſal, of force and form in the argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſincerity in the deſign, and laſtly modeſty and ingenuity in the ſtyle and terms, which are the ſeveral requiſites that can make a writing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degree worth the reading.</p>
               <p>This kind of Anatomy I will now take in hand, and by no other art then plain inciſion, shall with truth and perſpicuity diſcover the fallacies and groſs errors of the before mentioned Author, who delivers boldly his judgment upon what he do's not underſtand; or if he were not really ignorant, yet delivers unſincerely, and miſrepreſents thoſe things of which he treats: all which I shall demonſtrate in the following Chapters.</p>
               <p>After ſeveral attacks made by <hi>I. E. N. N.</hi> and others upon my ſmall Book, upon my ſelf, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> comes up confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to complete the victory Mr. I. <hi>S.</hi> as <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> to the Seige of <hi>Numantia,</hi> to amend the errors of the preceding warriors. And to appear a <hi>Scipio</hi> indeed in his preſent adventure, he promiſes himſelf ſo to beſet and ſtraighten us, as to make us burn our ſelves, as the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantines</hi> did, to prevent their falling into the hands of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueror.</p>
               <p>To compaſs this magnificent deſign, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> my good Lord and Patron, in the dedicatory Epiſtle of his book to his Excellency, that I ſhould be burned for a crime he calls a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53284:122"/>Blaſphemy, wherein all the learned men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are involved with me, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſay, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as now it ſtands, is not a ſecure way to Salvation. And the executioner of this ſevere ſentence paſſed upon us by Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> muſt not be the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> but our own Kings Prime Miniſter and Lieutenant in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He allow's me ſo much wit, as to know that I could not juſtifie my ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if I did hope to be ſaved in it, whereas believing I may, to forſake it, were a formal ſchiſm: thus much of wit he doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry injuriouſly deny to all other learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, ſaying, that all allow the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a ſecure way to Salvation, which is to ſay, they are all confeſſedly Schiſmatics.</p>
               <p>The inference is but too clear from his Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, confuſedly delivered, if thus ordered, All men that ſeparate from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, knowing and allowing it to be a ſafe way to Salvation, are formally and confeſſedly Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics; all Learned men of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do acknowledg and allow the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a ſafe way to Salvation: Therefore all of them are confeſſedly and formally Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics. This Theſis Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> preſents to the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> to win his favor.</p>
               <p>To clear the ground of all this diſcourſe, and ſee how bold and blind was the attemt of Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his charging me with Blaſphemy, ſee the occaſion given to him for it, that in the page 226 of my book (according to the firſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53284:123"/>of it at <hi>Dublin</hi>) rebuking their ordinary vaunt wherewith they delude the ſimple, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Proteſtants do allow Papiſts may be ſaved, but Papiſts do not allow that Proteſtants may be ſaved, &amp;c. I delivered theſe words following, <hi>but in neither do they ſay truth, for no Learned Proteſtant do's allow the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in general and abſolutely speaking to be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure way to Salvation, for all do agree in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many of their Tenets and practiſes are inconſiſtent with Salvation, tho ignorance may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly excuſe many of the ſimple ſort, but not ſuch as know their error, or with due care and inquiry may know it. On the other ſide,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This has netled the poor man to rage. Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he found himſelf to be of thoſe who know, or with due enquiry may know the damnable errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Now I deſire the judicious Reader to conſider, with what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of terms Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> calls it a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in me, to relate this ſentiment of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtants. Tho I were miſtaken, to call ſuch a miſtake Blaſphemy, is extravagant language.</p>
               <p>Three kinds of Blaſphemy I find mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Aquinas</hi> and other Schole-men,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To appropriate to God ſomething unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To deprive him of a perfection due to him,</p>
               <p n="3">3. To attribute to a creature any of Gods properties. To which of theſe claſſes will Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> reduce my miſtake, if it be not ſo what I relate of learned Proteſtants? That one of thoſe who ſit in the Market-places ſelling roots, should call it a Blaſphemy in another of her trade,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53284:123"/>to ſay, that her Turnips came out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> not being ſo, may be a cauſe of laughing; but that one pretending to learning, and a diſputant in divinity should ramble at this rate, I confeſs plainly it ſeems to me intolerable, and a ſad task to diſpute with a perſon of ſo irregular a ſtyle.</p>
               <p>But if what I related of learned Proteſtants be ſo indeed, which way comes it to be a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to tell truth? Now to know whether it be ſo, let any that ever heard learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants deliver their opinion upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or did read their writings, tell whether he knew any of them ſay, that the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in general, and abſolutely speaking, is a ſure way to Salvation, or whether they could ſay it in conſequence to their aſſertions, ever accuſing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of Idolatry, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, impiety, &amp;c. crimes certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Salvation, if Ignorance did not excuſe, or penitence heal the malady. The Teſtimony of Learned

                  <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> well verſed in the Doctrine of both parties, may ſerve for many to this purpoſe, who relating, that <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus à ſancta Clara,</hi> and the Jeſuit his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, among other Learned Romaniſts, do aſſure that ignorance and repentance may excuſe a Proteſtant from Damnation he dying in his error; adds theſe words, <hi>and this is all the charity which by your own confeſſion alſo the moſt favorable Proteſtants allow to Papiſts.</hi> Here we have witneſſes of both ſides affirming, that Proteſtants do not allow Salvation to Papiſts,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53284:124"/>if ignorance or repentance will not protect them: how then comes it to be ſo great a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in me to tell they ſay ſo; a greater Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox certainly to ſay it should be blaſphemy to tell it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>A Vindication of ſeveral Saints and worthy ſouls, our Anceſtors, from the ſentence of Damnation paſſed upon them by</hi> I. S.</head>
               <p>TO render me odious to my Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, to my own kindred, and to all good men, he pretends that I adjudg unto Hell his Excellencies Anceſtors, my own Anceſtors, <hi>St. Bernard, Aquinas,</hi> and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. The ground he alledges for fathering this ſevere ſentence upon me, is, that I should ſay, <hi>that in the Popiſh religion none may be ſaved,</hi> and which is more intolerable, <hi>that there is no Salvation in the Catholic Church.</hi> All men that know my Principles and Temper in writing and ſpeaking, will admire the impudence of this man, imputing to me ſuch deſperate rude Poſitions; That none may be ſaved in the Romish, or Popish Religion, I never ſaid with that generality, but with a limitation, leaving a gate to Salvation for innumerable good ſouls, and for the holy and renowned men he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as I shall now declare.</p>
               <p>To declare for damned all the adverſe parties
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53284:124"/>of Chriſtians without diſtinction, is a rashneſs I ever abhorred, and conſtantly oppoſed in the Romaniſts, when I was on their ſide, and which I would not imitate againſt my preſent adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; much leſs did I, or could I ſay, that there is no Salvation in the Catholic Church, out of which I expect no Salvation for my ſelf or others.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid indeed, and proved with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which <hi>I. S.</hi> will never ſolve, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, according to the preſent profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and practice of it, is not a ſafe way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, generally and abſolutely ſpeaking; that many of the Tenets and Practiſes of it, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Salvation, in ſuch, as underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the error of them, do continue to embrace them. This I have ſaid, and will maintain at all times, by the help of God, and truth; but how different this is from ſaying, that <hi>in the Roman Church a man may not be ſaved, and that there is no Salvation in the Catholic Church,</hi> any man of common ſenſe may eaſily conceive; and withall judg, how unpleaſing a work it is, to ſpend precious time in debating with a man of ſo confuſed brains and ill digeſted expreſſions. Now therefore, the foundation laied for the cenſure of Damnation paſſed againſt thoſe Saints and renowned men not being from me, but from the fancy or fiction of <hi>I. S.</hi> it remains that he is the Author of that malignant Cenſure: my work will be to vindicate the perſons inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from that cruell ſentence, by shewing that it is not a conſequence of my opinion above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, own'd and confirm'd by many thouſands of Learned and pious men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53284:125"/>
The ſtreſs of his Argument, and where he hopes to be more ſucceſsfull is, what concerns <hi>Thomas of Aquin.</hi> He ſayes, that the Sanctuary of ignorance which we allow to others for eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping Damnation can not avail him, being well verſed in Scripture, and an eminent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in moſt Sciences; and ſo he conceives his Damnation unavoidable in conſequence to my forementioned poſition, and the common ſenſe of all the reformed Churches; and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to ſound a Triumph as to a manifeſt victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But if Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his Logic makes a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to him of this conſequence, it do's not to me, nor will to any ordinary Logician, that underſtands the terms and ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. If he do's not know how to ſave <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> and ſeveral other good learned men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, from damnation, in the opinion of ſo many thouſands of Learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d men of the Reformed Churches, I can and will teach him. I am not of thoſe fiery ſpirits, reproved by the Royal piety of King <hi>James,</hi> who affirm, that in the Popiſh Religion none can be ſaved, as Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> do's falſely and maliciouſly to his own knowledg impoſe upon me. I incline with my ſtudy and wiſhes, and more willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my opinion for the Salvation then for the Damnation of men, when by the leaſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility induced thereunto.</p>
               <p>And firſt for <hi>Aquinas</hi> and other learned men of his time, I thus plead; The errors and foul practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were not ſo many then, as now: they increaſe daily. They have not bin ſo known, and cleared in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53284:125"/>Crucible of public oppoſition; none dared to check them; and ſo they kept credit. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, fallacies and abſurdities of Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his book, will not be ſo well known to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes poſſeſſed with prejudices, and to others that ſee it alone, as to indifferent perſons, that will conferr it with my exceptions againſt it; ſo it is with thoſe erroneous tenets that began to be in uſe in <hi>Aquinas</hi> his time, or ſomewhat before, and were not oppoſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for many learned men even of our own time, which ſeems more difficult, I ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ignorance may be pleaded. For which I advertiſe, that invincible Ignorance (according to the common uſe of Scholes and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe) is not that which by no means abſolutely poſſible may be avoided, but ſuch as one may not remedy by means obvious to him according to his ſtate and condition In this ſenſe Shepherds and the like in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>taly,</hi> that want inſtruction for knowing the Creed or Ten Commandments, are commonly excuſed upon the account of invincible Ignorance, and the fault laid upon their fathers, maſters, or curates. In like manner I ſay many profeſſors of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and divinity in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly ignorant of the malice contained in the erroneous Principles they profeſs, having ſucked them in their tender years, as divine veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties proceeding from a living reputed Infallible Autority. They never heard them controuled or examined, no books written againſt them were permitted to come in their ſight. They were taught, it was a ſin to doubt of the truth of their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53284:126"/>tenets; <hi>ergo</hi> thoſe men wanted the ordinary means of inſtruction, and conſequently may have the refuge of invincible Ignorance.</p>
               <p>All this I know to be ſo by my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Having lived in <hi>Spain</hi> many years, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had, for ſeveral of them, licence from the Inquiſitor general to read all manner of prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited books, the prohibition was ſo ſevere, that I could never find one book of a Proteſtant to read. And even in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where more liberty may be expected, there is a ſevere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of reading books oppoſing the <hi>Romiſh</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; which appeared particularly touching that ſmall book I publiſhed. For offering it to be read by a Romiſh prieſt, Vicar General of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Church in that kingdom, that he might ſee I did not without conſideration and reaſon what I did, he deſired to be excuſed from reading it, fearing it would raiſe in him doubts which he could not ſolve: and this injunction being ſo ſevere upon perſons of that degree, muſt be more indiſpenſable upon the vulgar.</p>
               <p>Means of inſtruction for knowing their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors being thus carefully prohibited to them of the Romiſh Communion in all times and places, we may favorably conceive, that many of them both learned and unlearned may have the excuſe of invincible Ignorance, the ſin ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Statiſts, that for temporal ends do debar them from the means of healthful knowledg.</p>
               <p>One touch more in favour of the learned. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many of them having beſtowed the flower of their age in ſtudies of Humanity, Philoſophy,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53284:126"/>and Divinity ſpeculative, are taken up, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten kept all their life time teaching thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, without ever reflecting upon, or having means to know the errors of their Church in the points controverted. They take them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credit of their inſtructors, for infallible verities, being continually beaten into their ears, with horror and execration againſt the oppoſite doctrine. And how great the power of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prejudice is, let the Dominicans and Jeſuits teſtifie. How fierce and eagerly doth each one act and opine for the Schole he was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in, and againſt the oppoſite?</p>
               <p>By this it appears how vain the Triumph of <hi>I. S.</hi> is, as if in my opinion all learned men dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were damned to hell. We have ſeen that impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentence to be a product of his fancy, no conſequence of any doctrine of mine. More raſh and wicked was his attemt in caſting the like ſentence of Damnation upon thoſe glorious Saints and great Doctors of the Church, St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> St <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> What have they to do with his errors, to be damned for them? Strong oppoſers, no Patrons of them were they; as partly I have already, and after will more fully declare.</p>
               <p>It appears likewiſe by this diſcourſe, how ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous his charge upon me is, of contradiction and ſpeaking againſt my conſcience in calling <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> a Saint.

It is not merit only gets that honor there. And tho we know all this to be ſo, we do not grudg to call thoſe Saints we find by cuſtom to be called ſo.</p>
               <p>And by all that is ſaid hitherto, we may ſee and wonder how rare the boldneſs of this man is, to term it Blaſphemy in me to relate the common opinion of all learned Proteſtants, or to conſent to it; and to propoſe to have us all burned for it, by ſentence of our own chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor: to pretend for this wicked attemt, the Authority of our Soveraign King <hi>James</hi> of glorious memory, whoſe Decrees and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments herein I do moſt willingly obey, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto: to impoſe upon me an opinion I never uttered by word, or writing, nor ever harbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my thought, <hi>that there is no Salvation in the Catholic Church; that her errors are inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Salvation;</hi> to clip my words, and force them againſt my will and well declared meaning to his malicious purpoſes.</p>

And notwithſtanding theſe enormous exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and abſurdities of his ſpeech, his preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo blind, that he concludes his Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Epiſtle, ſaying, that tho his Treatiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing elſe but this check he gives to me, it muſt be grateful to his Excellency. If this addreſs were made to a weak or dull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it were yet criminal enough; but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſo deep a judgment and well known wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as that of my Lord Lieutenant, pardon me ſacred laws of modeſty, if I ſay its a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent boldneſs.

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Mr.</hi> S. <hi>his cold defence of the Infallibility of his Church examined.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BOTH in my Declaration and in my print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sermon or diſcourſe againſt the errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I ſignified, that the only anchor left to keep me in the communion of it, after a ſtrong apprehenſion of its erroneous Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, was the opinion of Infallibility granted to that Church, and the Head of it; But that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor being cut off, and a clear diſcovery made of the fallacy of their pretended Infallibility, I ſet open my eyes and heart to receive the light which God ſent me in his holy Writ, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their pernicious errors, and declare for his truth againſt them.</p>
               <p>My adverſary, preceiving this to be the hinge all the Fabric go's on, and that if I were perſwaded to that Infallibility, I would blind my eyes and follow, without any further diſpute, the conduct of ſuch a Guide, goes about to ſet up the ſaid Infallibility with all his power, and ſo entitles his book, <hi>The unerring unerreable Church.</hi> But his way to compaſs his deſign is very odd, which is, yielding to my firſt and main attack upon it, that is the uncertainty of ſuch an Infallibility to aſſiſt them, which I prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the diſconformity of their Authors in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53284:128"/>it, and the weakneſs of the grounds they produce for it. But Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> in the page 167. gives me leave to believe what I pleaſe therein; <hi>Its no article of faith, ſaith he, that the Pope is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. If he miſliked that doctrine, he might have denyed it, and remain a Catholic. A Catholic</hi> I may remain, and do, but not of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that Prop failing for thoſe <hi>ſtructures,</hi> which I ſaw clearly to be ruinous without it.</p>
               <p>It is an intolerable cavil to ſay I ſhould ſpeak of the <hi>Pope</hi> alone, or of the <hi>Roman</hi> Dioceſs, to delude the Reader with impertinent Digreſſions, as often he doth, I having clearly expreſſed my meaning to be, that neither the <hi>Pope</hi> alone, nor in a Council (ſuch as that of <hi>Trent,</hi>) nor the Congregation under his obedience are infallible. To ſay the ſaid Congregation ſhould be the Church Univerſal, (which I allow according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Expreſſion, to be <hi>the pillar and ground of truth</hi>) is an arrogant begging of a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which will never be allow'd to them, all Chriſtian Churches that differ from them, which are far the greater part of Chriſtendom, crying againſt their blind preſumtion in appropriate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto themſelves the name of the <hi>Catholic Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Church truly Univerſal, compoſed of all believers in Chriſt, whether diffuſive, or repreſentative in a Council truly Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenicall and free, ſuch as were the firſt four General Councils, (and ſuch as was not the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi>) is to have the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, ſo that tho it be not properly infallible, yet it ſhall not err in things funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53284:129"/>to mens Salvation, I do piouſly believe, and of my meaning therein I gave him no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to doubt.</p>
               <p>Therefore if he will ſpeak to the purpoſe, granting it is not an Article of faith, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is infallible in the ſenſe I denyed infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to him, that is to ſay, in a Council of thoſe depending upon him, or out of it, it follow's they have no certainty for their Tenets relying upon the <hi>Popes</hi> Infallibility; which being no article of faith, cannot be certain in it ſelf, nor conſequently give certainty to things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon it. He only allow's Infallibility to the <hi>Pope</hi> jointly with a general Council. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gratifies the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> who may by this plead for indemnity, notwithſtanding the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh againſt them; which being not confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or autorized by a general Council in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the <hi>Pope,</hi> cannot pretend to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in Mr. <hi>I.</hi> S. his opinion, who hereby muſt incenſe againſt himſelf all the party adverſe to the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> which will prove too hard for him.</p>
               <p>But he ſaies all Catholics do agree in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the <hi>Pope</hi> and a generall Council. Therefore <hi>Aquinas, Turrecremata</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro</hi> are in his opinion no Catholics, of whom

                  <hi>Canus</hi> relates, that the Church, even <hi>Pope</hi> and Council together, may err materially in their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53284:129"/>opinion, as I mentioned in the 30. page of my diſcourſe, which if he did conſider and examine, he would not ſo peremtorily aſſert, that all Catholics do agree in the Infallibility of Pope and Councel jointly.</p>
               <p>Neither indeed do's Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himſelf ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>em to be very ſtrong in the belief of this Infallibility, for in the comfort he gives his brethren on this account, extolling magnificently their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs herein above Proteſtants, he ſo orders the matter, that their comfort muſt not be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the real exiſtence of that Infallibility; but upon a ſtrong apprehenſion or belief of it, tho not extant. <hi>It is a comfort, ſaies he, to an unacquainted Traveller, to be guided by one whom he firmly believes to be acquainted with the way, tho really your guide were not acquainted with the way; if you c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

This is ſuch another comfort as the grand Turk gives to his men, that dying in his quarrel they go immediately to <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> tho it be not ſo, its a comfort to think it is. A ſad comfort for the unhappy ſouls loſt, but commodious for the <hi>Turk,</hi> to get by theſe means people to ſight deſperately and dye for him.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with the Church, or Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> To believe they are infallible is a ſatisfaction to the people, and very important for the aut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>OUR Adverſary triumphs upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid comfort of Papiſts, in apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Guide to be Infallible, tho he be not ſo indeed; which comfort he ſaies the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants cannot have, being guided by a Church, which they believe is not ſo well aſſured of the way but they may err. God forbid Proteſtants ſhould not have a better warrant for the truth of their Doctrine, then that he gives to Papiſts. They have the infallible word of God, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering all their doctrine, and clearly containing all that is neceſſary to Salvation, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect life, as appears evidently by what I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the diſcourſe which Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> go's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to oppoſe, and will be further evidenced, by ſhewing how vain and weak the oppoſition is. They have beſides, in the general tradition of the Church, a full and ſufficient certainty that the books, commonly received for Canonical, are the true word of God, and therefore are certain of Gods infallible autority, aſſiſting in favor of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53284:131"/>the verities contained in thoſe books: which kind of certainty tho only morall, touching the exiſtence of Gods revelation in favor of thoſe verities, joined with an abſolute and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Certainty, that whatſoever God reveals is infallible verity, makes up all the certainty that a pious and prudent believer ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in matters of divine faith.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> talks of a kind of certainty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for Divine faith, which I doubt mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, whether he, or any of his party, ever had for all thoſe articles they pretend to be of faith. He tells us (and takes it upon credit of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors, without much examination, as often he does in other matters) that for all acts of belief touching revealed truths, an abſolute certainty is requiſite, clearing the believer from all manner of doubt. If you ſpeak of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective certainty, relating to the myſtery reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all true believers have it, being fully aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that God cannot reveal an untruth: but if you ſpeak of a ſubjective certainty, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all manner of doubts as well touching the truth of Divine revelation if extant, as of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of it, I do vehemently ſuſpect, that both you and your inſtructors do ſpeak againſt your ſenſe and experience, eſpecially touching points controverted, and not explicitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture; ſuch as is Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for example, that myſtery which <hi>Scotus, Ockam, Cajetan,</hi> and others of your ableſt Schole men could never find in ſcripture, nor agreeable to the rules of common reaſon. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your breaſt for judging, whether you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53284:131"/>have touching this point that degree of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty excluding all manner of doubt, which you pretend to be neceſſary for all acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief touching revealed truths.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> muſt not expect from me, that I ſhould take notice off, and purſue all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies he runs upon in his book; my intention being only to clear the truth in our main concern, and therefore to follow him as far as I find him ſpeak pertinently to the points I propoſed, for diſcovering their groſſer errors, which forced me to a ſeparation from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Chapter of his book, he enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon points we allow, and know upon firmer grounds then his proofs for them, That God is to be adored; That he has revealed himſelf what manner of worſhip he requires; That this worſhip is true religion; That the ſame is but one; That God hath afforded ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means to know which is the true ſaving Religion; That divine faith muſt be grounded upon an infallible autority, fully aſſuring us of the truth of its propoſals. The controverſy is, what authority this is, whether of the Scripture as we believe, or of the <hi>Pope</hi> and Council, as he pretends.</p>
               <p>For a viſible Judge to aſcertain us of Divine verities, I once argued, that it became Divine wiſdom and goodneſs, to provide us ſuch to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine our controverſies, which otherwiſe would be endleſs. It was replied, that we ought to be wary in cenſuring Gods wiſdom, if this or that ſeeming to us convenient, were not don
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53284:132"/>in the government of the world. I acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed force in the reply, and did further it with an inſtance, that we may as well ſay, that it belongeth to the power and goodneſs of God, not to permit his holy Laws to be tranſgreſſed by vile creatures: and as we do not judg it a failure in his goodneſs to permit ſins, ſo ought we not to waver in the opinion of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if he has not appointed us a viſible Judg for our direction, having given us the Holy Scriptures, which abound with all light and heavenly doctrine to ſuch as are not willfuly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> not accuſtomed to approve any thing in his opponents, calls this my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment weakneſs, and to my inſtance, ſaies, it becomes the goodneſs of God to permit ſins, and the ſcandals of <hi>Popes,</hi> for the exerciſe of their liberty.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53284:132"/>are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed to all good works;</hi> this is the gloſs of our Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt; <hi>But I infer the contrary: whereas Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, tho repleniſhed they be with heavenly light, are not ſufficient to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, and <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaies, that they are not ſufficient to declare unto us what we ought to believe; which is clearly to ſay, that they are not able to make us wiſe unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for certainly without due belief we can not be ſaved. This interpretation is like to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother attributed by a <hi>Fryar</hi> to <hi>Lyra,</hi> being convinced, that the propoſition he denyed was in Scripture, he replied it was true, the Text ſaid ſo, but <hi>Nicolas de Lyra</hi> ſaid the contrary. So tis in our caſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies that the Scripture is able to make us wiſe unto Salvation; but Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaies the contrary: which of them ought we to beleive?</p>
               <p>I ſhould expect from the ſubtilty of our Sophiſter to tax me with giving my concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for reaſon of it ſelf: ſuch is the identity in ſenſe of my aſſertion with S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for proof of it. That Holy Scripture is ſufficient to inſtruct us for Salvation and a good life, is what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, and what I ſay, no more nor leſs; but it is for ſlow wits to fetch out of a Text only what is contained in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53284:133"/>it: Sublime underſtandings muſt find in it more then the Author did mean, nay, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of his words and meaning. It is not for them to ſubmit to that rule of Canoniſts, that it is not a right way of interpreting a Text to mend it. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> mends the Text of S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerting the contrary of it, and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary aſſertion by him ſubſtituted, he inferrs a contrary conſequence to that I inferred from S. <hi>Pauls</hi> aſſertion. I inferr thus, Whereas Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſufficient to our full inſtruction, we ought not to waver in our opinion of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if he did not appoint an infallible living Judg to direct us. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> thinking that a ſmall d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſcovery, thus reſolves; <hi>But I infer the contrary, Whereas Scriptures, tho repleniſht with heavenly light, are not ſufficient to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us what we ought to believe, we might waver in our Opinion of Gods Goodneſs, if he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point an infallible living Judg for to inſtruct us.</hi> I leave the judicious Reader to reflect upon the ſtock of inſolencies heaped up in theſe lines, to give the he flatly to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and pronounce a ſentence againſt the goodneſs of God, if he did not what Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> thinks ſit to be don.</p>
               <p>But ſee how our admirable Doctor teacheth S. <hi>Paul</hi> to mend his error, that where he ſaid Scripture is able to make us wiſe to Salvation, he did not ſay it of Scripture alone, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with thoſe Auxiliaries, Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> is pleaſed to appoint. As if one to magnifie his ſtrength, did ſay he could carry two hundred weight, and being on a trial found unable to do it, to verifie his ſaying, ſhould alledg, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53284:133"/>that he did not mean he could carry ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but he and a Horſe with him. Such quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles as theſe are more becoming Mr. <hi>S.</hi> then S. <hi>Paul;</hi> and ſo he may keep them for himſelf, and not father them upon the great <hi>Apostle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further he proceeds to oppoſe St <hi>Paul,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when he wrot that Epiſtle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> the whole Canon of Scripture was not completed; and only the whole Canon, and no part of it, can be ſufficient means for our inſtruction: therefore the Scripture that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke of, cannot be a ſufficient means for inſtructing us to Salvation. Herein our Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is twice impious, firſt, in taxing the great Apoſtles aſſertion with untruth: next, that the <hi>Oracle</hi> of God, delivered to men in each time for their inſtruction to Salvation, ſhould not be complete and ſufficient.</p>
               <p>By this it appears well how much a ſtranger this man is to the common Doctrine of Divines, who affirm, that in the Apoſtles Creed are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all neceſſary verities to be believed for Salvation; and in the Ten Comman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if therein he did ſpeak properly, or ſincerely, he would have leſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from us.

               <p>The terms and ſtate of the Queſtion being thus cleared, it follows to declare how imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent his prolixe excurſion and vain oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, in telling us the diverſity of Opinions that were in different times about Canonical Scripture, and the difficulty of aſcertaining us which is the true one. This is an old device of thoſe of his faction, to decline the main controverſy in hand, wherein they ſtill betray the weakneſs of their Cauſe. They and he ſhould remember, the points controverted are among parties that agree in reverencing the Bible for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53284:135"/>the infallible Word of God. And if he thinks the part of it received for Canonical, by common conſent, will not ſuffice for ending our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, we admit willingly St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> rule for clearing the difficulties touching particular Books, the Authority of the Church, and the Tradition of it, as deſcribed by <hi>Lirinenſis, Quod ſemper, quod ubique, quod apud omnes.</hi> What was in all time, in all places, and by all Chriſtians delivered, that we take for a true Apoſtolic Tradition, and to it we reſolve to ſtand or fall, as well for diſcerning Canonical Scripture, as for underſtanding the true meaning of it.</p>

This is Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his folly, in taking for granted in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates with us, that the Romiſh faction is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Univerſal Church. So great an Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon diſputes, ſhould learn that rule of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants, <hi>Quod gratis dicitur gratis negatur,</hi> what is barely ſaid without proof, is ſufficiently refuted with a bare denial.</p>

This alone, well conſidered, will ſuffice to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw man Chapters of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Book. What makes him ſpend time in telling us of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of finding out which is true Scripture, the rule truly infallible of our belief, when he ſees us thus aſcertain'd of it? why do's he trouble us with ſpeaking of a Criterion or beam of light pretended by Fanatics, confeſſing at the ſame time that to be exploded by Proteſtants? is it to make his Book ſwell?</p>
               <p>But finding he cannot hide Scripture from us, he will have us to be beholden to the Pope for the true meaning of it: he muſters up a ſtore of Arguments objected by Pagans, Arians and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellians againſt the Myſtery of the Trinity: and would have us leave the points preſent for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering them; let him go to the Fathers that propoſe the Arguments, they will deliver the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wier. The Councils truly Oecumenical of the Prmitive Church, and univerſal Tradition do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us of the right meaning of Scripture, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe points. Where comes here a need of the Pope and his faction to aſcertain us?</p>
               <p>He finds a ſpecial myſtery in the point of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, that either we for diminiſhing, or they for adding to the Words of God, are in a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable error, deſerving to be blotted out of the Book of life, <hi>Apoc.</hi> xx. 9. The danger is clearly on their ſide, no mention of Purgatory being in he written Word of God, as ſhall after appear.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Chapter he is very prolixe in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us the Church is a Body, and muſt have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly a Head and Members ſubject to it. We allow all, provided Chriſt be the Head, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53284:136"/>all others, both Paſtors and flock, Members ſubject to him, as it was in the Apoſtles times; each one of them preached Chriſt, none himſelf for Head. There is no memory of any pretence in St. <hi>Peter</hi> over St. <hi>Andrew</hi> in <hi>Achaia,</hi> or over St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or over any other of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in their reſpective Provinces, no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them upon him.</p>
               <p>What he adds of Obedience due from the Flock to the Paſtors is right, ſpeaking of each Flock in regard of their ordinary lawful Paſtors: right alſo, that in difficulties emergent of greater moment, a National Synod ſhould be congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as that he mentions in the United Provinces in <hi>Dordrecht.</hi> Right, likewiſe what the Synod of <hi>Delpht</hi> reſolved, that, tho the former Synod was fallible, there was no obligation of conſcience in obeying the decrees of it, as there is in all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey the orders of a lawful Superior, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for ſuch. And the Arminians having ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that Synod, and acknowledged it to be lawfully congregated, may well be declared obliged to ſubmit to the Decrees of it, ſo far as not to diſturb the public peace by illegal oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions? But all this comes very ſhort of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his purpoſe, ſince the Reformed Churches never ſubmitted to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor did acknowledg it for a lawful free Oecumenical Council; and how could they think it to be ſuch, when the party accuſed, the Pope and his Court, was to be the judg and ſupreme Arbiter of the cauſe? His reſiſtance to a true lawful free Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, is the cauſe of all the combuſtion and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we have in Chriſtendom.</p>

He takes for an advantage againſt Scripture, that I ſaid, the reading of it made me doubt of the truth of thoſe Articles the Roman Church preſs'd upon my belief, as if it were not able to aſcertain me: But I thank God and the light of his holy Word, which made me doubt of what your Party would have me ſwallow without doubt or examen, and from the doubt brought me to a certainty of your corruptions, and of the truth of the Primitive truly Catholic, and of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Faith profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> ſuch a certainty, as renders my mind quiet and ſatisfied, that I have the guidance of Gods Word for the belief propoſed to me, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a ſufficient and full aſſurance of the truth of it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>LOW goes the cauſe with our Adverſary, when he pretends to a milder ſentence againſt their error, in attributing Infallibility to the Pope. He will not have it called Blaſphemy; we may reſt contented with finding it an error of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; by that alone the whole ſtructure of their tenets againſt us falls down: but being mention was made of Blaſphemy in their aſſertion, we will ſhew how faint a defence Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> prepares againſt that cenſure. It is a wonder that one ſo prodigal of the like cenſure as we have ſeen him to be, in the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe, tearm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a Blaſphemy in me, to ſay that the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> denied the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as now it ſtands, to be a ſafe way to ſalvation: and in the eighth Chapter of his Book, ſaying, that Proteſtants may not without Blaſphemy alledg Scripture for their tenets: ſhould take ſo great a ſcandal at ſaying it is a Blaſphemy to make the Pope Infallible; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the ſaying is grounded upon princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their own Authors. But it is no great wonder that Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> oppoſing this cenſure ſhould not go the right way to it, nor heed the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53284:138"/>form or force of my Argument, for that is his conſtant cuſtom.</p>
               <p>The Argument was <hi>ad hominem,</hi> grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on premiſes taken out of Authors of his own party: the firſt was, that it is a Blaſphemy to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to a creature any of Gods properties; ſo <hi>Aquinas</hi> 1. <hi>p. q.</hi> 16. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>ad tertiam.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Premiſe was, that Infallibility is a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God not communicable to any man, ſo the the ſame <hi>Aquinas,</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. <hi>q.</hi> 13. <hi>art.</hi> 1. Theſe two Premiſes being granted, the concluſion is evident, that it is a Blaſphemy to attribute Infallibility to the Pope: which concluſion being contained in the two Premiſes, the truth of it is to ſtand or fall with <hi>Aquinas</hi> his Autority. If Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> were formal in arguing, his way to anſwer this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were, to examine whether <hi>Aquinas</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaid Premiſes aſcribed to him, and ſo come directly to my concluſion, that in principles of their own Divines, it is a Blaſphemy to make the Pope Infallible.</p>
               <p>But what do we mention <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and formal diſputing to Mr. <hi>I. S?</hi> he do's not ſeem to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that kind of reading or dealing: he will not be tyed to their ſtrict rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. Now let us follow him in his own way, and ſee how he argues being ſet at liberty. He taxes me with ignorance, for not knowing that God may lend his Attributes to men, and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of Infallibility being but paſſed over in a grace, and lent to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> it muſt not be a Blaſphemy to aſcribe it to him.</p>
               <p>Firſt I enquire of this Magiſterial man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infallibility be an Attribute of God incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53284:138"/>to a mutable man, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſeems to ſay? and being ſo, whether it be not likely it may not be lent to another, as his Omnipotency cannot, both repreſenting an unlimited perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? for as Omnipotency includes a relation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite effects produceable, ſo the Infallibility aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the Pope for determining without er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror all queſtions poſſible to occur about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſeems to argue an unlimited perfection, the ſaid queſtions being endleſs, the heavenly Preacher declaring, that God having made man upright, he has entangled himſelf in infinite queſtions: which the Latin Vulgar Tranſlation delivers thus: <hi>Hoc inveni quod fecerit Deus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem rectum; &amp; ipſe ſe infinitis miſcuit quaeſtionibus.</hi> And in the 12. Ch. and 12. v. he ſaith, <hi>That of many Books there is no end.</hi> The queſtions deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable being thus unlimited, the faculty rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them for an unerring determination muſt be likewiſe unlimited, and conſequently of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfection. Will he allow ſo much to the Pope? He challenges me often, and defies all my Divinity to anſwer his Arguments; will he give me leave to challenge once all his Sophiſtry for a direct and formal ſolution of this Query? And whilſt he finds it,</p>
               <p>I enquire, ſecondly, Whether it be granted and allowed that God has lent his Infallibility to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> to determine without er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror all queſtions poſſible occurring about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? whether I have not denv'd reſolutely the ſaid grant to be made; and confuted the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations they pretend for it, to his knowledg? being ſo, whether it be a proper kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53284:139"/>to take for a Principle againſt us, the Concluſion in debate? whether it be not a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable arrogance, to parallel his Pope with the holy Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do acknowledg and reverence for unerring Oracles of God to declare his holy Will to us? whether it be not inſolence to ſay, that our cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon Romaniſts for attributing Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Pope, ſhould reflect upon the ſacred Organs of the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking to us by their mouth, as Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> do's moſt impiouſly pretend?</p>
               <p>And being I ſignified the cenſure of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon their pretence to Infallibility to be of their own Authors, not of my making, as not concerned for aggravating their crime, ſo much as to ſhew they are abſolutely in an error, I will further declare, how bitter they are in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring one another in this particular.

Now this entire ſubmiſſion of our Spirit, and of all our intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals comprehended in the Act of our Faith, is no other then that adoration which we pay to the prime Verity it ſelf; and therefore whoſoever he be that renders it to the word of a man (whatever rank he may hold in the Church) who ever ſays that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves with a faith Divine, that which he would not believe, but becauſe a man has affirmed it, do's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute man in the place of God, transfers to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that which is alone due to the Creator, and

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Our Adverſaries corruption of Scripture detected.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OUR Adverſary certainly never look'd into the Bible for the Texts he alledges for the Infallibility of his Church, but ſnatch'd them out of ſome of his old Controvertiſts, whoſe cuſtom is to clip and cut Scripture to their own pretences, without regard of their true meaning. Or if he has ſeen them with their contexts, he has bin ſtrangely dull, in not perceiving the right ſenſe of them very obvious to any ordinary good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; or malicious in miſrepreſenting the meaning of them. This is eſpecially ſeen in his Allegation of theſe words, <hi>Joh.</hi> XV. 26. <hi>When the Paraclete will come, whom I will ſend from my Father, the ſpirit of truth, he will give teſtimony of me, and ye will give teſtimony.</hi> This he will have us take for a certain teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſts aſſiſtance promiſed to his Church. If he did ſee the half verſe immediatly following, which he left out, or his Tutors cut off, he would find, that theſe words were ſpoken to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, with circumſtances making them impoſſible to be applied to his Church. The verſe reſtored to its integrity ſaies thus, <hi>And ye alſo ſhall bear witneſs, becauſe ye have bin with me from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> What man in his ſenſes would think thoſe words appliable to the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> Were
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53284:142"/>the Fathers of that Council with Chriſt from the the beginning? was the Holy Ghoſt not yet deſcended?</p>
               <p>He confirms further his opinion out of <hi>Acts</hi> the XV. 28. where the Council of the Apoſtles and Elders at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deciding the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy concerning Circumciſion, delivers their opinion thus: <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us,</hi> ſignifying that the Holy Ghoſt did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them: and that grounded on the words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> XV. 26. <hi>When the Paraclete will come, he ſhall give teſtimony of me, and you ſhall give teſtimony of me.</hi> If that be the ground of the Apoſtles Phraſe, we have ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to whom that promiſe was given, whether to the Apoſtles alone, or the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to be for ever. We have ſeen that the Text in its integrity cannot be applied to the latter: But Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> of his own autority declares that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made by Chriſt, not only to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but to the Roman Church for ever.</p>
               <p>And to make this latter Text ſound ſomthing like to his purpoſe, he patches it up with a piece of a verſe fetch'd out of <hi>Matth.</hi> XXVIII. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the conſummation of the world.</hi> This uſual art of theirs, of cutting from the Texts what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their purpoſe, and patching them with other words far fetch'd, that may have a gloſs or appearance of their pretention, may be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed with more ſafety in converſation, or in a Sermon to a vulgar Auditory, then in a ſerious debate by print expoſed to a ſtrict examen. This is a cheat like that uſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> with rotten Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to ſet them out for ſound. They cut off the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53284:142"/>rotten pieces, and glue together the ſound frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to an appearance of a fair Apple; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing handled more cloſe, it falls in pieces and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the cheat. This abominable <hi>Legerdemain</hi> is too often ſeen in their Pulpits, fathering upon the Goſpel forſooth moſt execrable Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, extolling their ſeveral new Saints (to whom they would gain devotion, and by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion mony to their Coffers) above the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, above the Angels, above Chriſt, and all that is in heaven, to the perpetual ſcandal of the diſcreet part of their own flock, and edification of none. All is ſanctified with them, by repeting at the end of every deſperate diſcourſe, ſome words of the Goſpel, as a burden of the ſong, tho with no relation in its ſenſe to their purpoſe. This is the art Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> uſeth with the teſtimony rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Acts</hi> XV. touching the aſſiſtance of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> grounded as he confeſſes upon the aforeſaid Text of <hi>John</hi> XV. 26. declared to relate only to the Apoſtles then preſent; and Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> of his own head will have it extended to the Roman Church for ever; and his Interpretation muſt be taken for Canonical Scripture, by cloſing it up with this fragment of the twentieth verſe of <hi>Matthew</hi> the XXVIII. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the conſummation of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text he corrupts and cuts off, <hi>Matth.</hi> XXVIII. contains a promiſe of Chriſt to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Church founded, and Faith preached by them, that he will aſſiſt them for ever, ſaying, <hi>I am with you all the daies, until the conſummation of the world.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> better then Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> will tell us the meaning of theſe words, gloſſing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53284:143"/>thus upon them: <hi>qui uſque ad conſummationem ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi cum diſcipulis ſe futurum eſſe promittit, &amp; illos oſtendit ſemper eſſe victuros, &amp; ſe nunquam à creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus receſſurum.</hi> In theſe words our Saviour promiſes to his Diſciples life everlaſting, and to the Church founded by them, and to all true believers in him, his perpetual aſſiſtance. This aſſiſtance of Chriſt to his own true Church, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſteps and doctrine of the Apoſtles, we believe with joy, but cannot approve the Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> and his brethren, in appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating all ſuch promiſes to their own Faction, and perpetually taking for granted in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates with us, that to be the only Church favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch gracious promiſes, being indeed but a very corrupt Member of the Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, to whom theſe promiſes were made; a thing which we do not ſay barely, but prove evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.</p>
               <p>Another example of their skill in clipping and corrupting Scripture, he fetches out of the ſame Store-houſe, upon the words of <hi>John</hi> XIV. 16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, the ſpirit of truth, that will abide with you for ever, who will lead you unto all truth.</hi> I diſcovered their abuſe of this Text by reſtoring it to its integrity, which according to their own Bible goes in theſe words: <hi>If ye love me keep my commandments, and I will ask my Father, and he ſhall give you another Paraclete, that he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive.</hi> By the firſt words we ſee this to be a conditional promiſe, limited to ſuch as love God and keep his Commandments: by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53284:143"/>the latter words, worldly and ſinful men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly excluded from receiving that gracious aſſiſtance of the Spirit of truth: for which mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words I related the Gloſs interlineal and ordinary.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe our Adverſary oppoſes thus, that after the former clauſe, <hi>if you love me keep my commandments,</hi> there is a <hi>punctum,</hi> and then follows a diſtinct verſe, <hi>and I will ask my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he will give you another Paraclete,</hi> &amp;c. which makes an abſolute ſenſe independent from the former. This is indeed a ſubtilty well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Sophiſter; as if a <hi>punctum</hi> may not be interpoſed betwixt ſeveral clauſes of one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe tending to the ſame end; or betwixt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and a concluſion deduced from them: as if the copulative particle <hi>and</hi> did not ſignify a conjunction of both clauſes, and an influence of the one upon the other; as if all that were not cleared by the words I quoted in the Margin of the Gloſs interlineal, <hi>Mundus, i. e. remanens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mator mundi, cum quo nunquam eſt amor Dei;</hi> and of the Gloſs ordinary, <hi>non habent ſpirituales ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los quibus Spiritum Sanctum videant mundi ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores.</hi> Here we ſee both Gloſſes denying the effect of that glorious promiſe to profane world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and conſequently the promiſe made only to lovers of God, and keepers of his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. If our Adverſary were ingenuous, he would ſpare his ſilly ſubtilties, ſeeing them obſtructed by this ſtating of the caſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ANother grand Argument he has, which he ſaies reſolutely I can never anſwer, is this, that if the foreſaid promiſe, <hi>John</hi> XIV. 16. was conditional, as above-mentioned, it follows, we cannot be ſure the Goſpel is infallible, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as no Text of Scripture</hi> (ſaies he, pag. 89.) <hi>tells us that the Evangeliſts were in the ſtate of Grace when they wrote the Goſpel, nor nothing elſe gives us aſſurance of it.</hi> My firſt anſwer to this ſo unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Argument is, that if this man had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered this expreſſion in <hi>Spain,</hi> and were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Inquiſition, his body would ſuffer for it, if his intellect were not reduced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and repent the horrid impiety of it. And I am certainly perſwaded, that there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that has any ſenſe of piety in him, whether Proteſtant or Papiſt, but will cry out with horror againſt the inſolent impiety of this man, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo irreverently of thoſe ſacred Organs of the Holy Ghoſt, and bleſſed Diſciples of Chriſt, confirmed by him in grace, as is the common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and expreſſion of Chriſtians, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4. for whoſe perſeverance in grace our Saviour praied
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53284:144"/>ſo fervently to his heavenly Father, as we ſee in <hi>John</hi> the XVII. 11. <hi>Holy Father keep through thine own name thoſe thou haſt given me.</hi> Upon which words <hi>Maldonate</hi> delivers this Gloſs: <hi>Non ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Chriſtus ut nunc à peccatis liberentur, ſed ut jam liberati in eo ſtatu quo erant conſerventur, ne quis ab eâ decedat gratiâ, quam conſecutus ſuo erat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficio, quemadmodum</hi> Judae <hi>contigerat.</hi> That our Saviour praied for their perſeverance in grace, that none of them ſhould fall from it as <hi>Judas</hi> did. And will this raſh man ſay, that the praier of our Saviour was not heard, nor his requeſt granted by his heavenly Father, in favor of his beloved Diſciples? If he will not be ſo profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gately impious, how dares he ſay, <hi>that no Text of Scripture tells us, that the Evangeliſts were in the ſtate of Grace when they wrote the Goſpel, nor nothing elſe gives us aſſurance of it?</hi> If his Book did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no other crime then this unchriſtian expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, any true diſciple of Chriſt, and believer of his Goſpel, ought to judg the ſaid Book more worth the burning then the reading.</p>
               <p>He is not yet contented with the damnable expreſſion fore-mentioned, but muſt raiſe his cenſure againſt the truth of the Goſpel of Chriſt to a higher degree, p. 89. ſaying, <hi>that not only we are not ſure of the Infallibility of the Goſpel, but that we are aſſured it is not infallible;</hi> and this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and the Goſpel dictated by him, he muſt father upon the Proteſtant Church; but upon a ground ſo much of his own making, that any diſpaſſionate man, and not blind, may ſee the whole aſſertion to be his own, and a product of his inclination, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53284:145"/>appears here, and in many other places, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the foundations of all Chriſtian Belief. The ground he gives for this latter moſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Blaſphemy is, That the common doctrine of the Proteſtant Church is, <hi>That it is impoſſible to keep Gods Commandments;</hi> therefore ſaies he, <hi>The Evangeliſts when they wrote did not keep Gods Commandments, and conſequently they could not have the Paraclete to lead them into truth.</hi> I never yet heard any Proteſtant deliver ſuch a deſperate propoſition as this he fathers upon them, which thus delivered categorically, without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration or limitation, were to ſay, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any man to be ſaved; our Saviour often declaring, that the only way to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting is to keep Gods Commands. It were alſo to give the lie to our Redeemer, ſaying, that <hi>his yoke is eaſy, and his burden light,</hi> Mat. XI. 30. and <hi>that his Commandments are not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. V. 3. If he knows any Proteſtant Writer to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered that poſition in that latitude; why do's not he tell me who he is, and where he ſaith it, that I may judg accordingly of the Author and of the Doctrine? Muſt I take it upon his credit, having ſo many experiences of the untruth of his relations? That he muſt not expect from me. I ſuppoſe he found this doctrine, which he ſaies to be common in the Proteſtant Church, where he found me ſaying, that <hi>there is no Salvation in the Catholic Church,</hi> as he do's moſt impudently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon me in his Dedicatory Epiſtle to my Lord Lieutenant.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53284:146"/>I conclude the Aſſertion pretended to flow from it, to be of his own invention, and his own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent.

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Our Adverſaries pretention to preſcription, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in favor of the Infallibility of their Church rejected: his impoſing on me, and on the Church of</hi> England, <hi>diſcovered further.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OUR Sophiſter finding but little right by Scripture, or reaſon, for the pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of his Church, appeals to the title of Preſcription, that they have bin long time in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this prerogative, and ought not to be diſturbed now in the uſe of it. Here he prepares a defence for thieves and robbers. If they have our goods long time in their poſſeſſion, we muſt leave them to ſuch poſſeſſors, and not diſturb them in the uſe of them. The Turk is hereby juſtified in his poſſeſſion of the holy Land, and other Dominions of Chriſtian Princes he has robbed. The attempt of the ſaid Princes in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing this Robber, is unjuſt, according to Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his Logic. In it he could not find this rule of Law, <hi>Quae ab initio ſunt male conſtituta, tempore non convaleſcunt,</hi> That what was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the beginning, grows not by continuance lawful: nor this other, <hi>Non debet quis commodum reportare ex crimine,</hi> none ought to find an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in a guilt for his defence. An unjuſt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper by a continuance of his uſurpation, is rendred rather more guilty then excuſable. We have ſhown by evident proofs, that the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53284:148"/>of the Roman Church to Infallibility was, and is ſtill an unjuſt uſurpation, a robbery of a priviledg belonging unto God and his holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, communicated to the Apoſtles, founders of Chriſtian Religion, and to the Church truly Catholic and Univerſal, ſticking to the Doctrine and Belief which Chriſt and his Apoſtles left to us, not to that factious party devoted to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> would have us take for the only Church, committing in all his diſcourſes a perpetual Soleciſm againſt the laws of a Diſputant, which is, to take for granted the ſubject of the Debate, which is conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd to them. But his Logic will not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe niceties.</p>
               <p>Now therefore to accuſe us that we diſturb them in the poſſeſſion of their Infallibility, is like the complaint of a certain Gentleman againſt a Merchant, calling on him for an old debt. He ranted and ſwore he was a troubleſom compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for importuning for the payment of a debt of ſo many years, as if it were but of yeſterday; his delay in paying, was an increaſe of his guilt. The retaining of another mans goods, as well as the taking them away againſt his will, is robbery. Thus it is in our caſe: the pretention of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faction to Infallibility, was a robbery from the beginning, an impoſing upon man kind, as I have proved; and the continuance of it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their guilt: why will Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> make this increaſe of their guilt an excuſe of it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to ſay, that his Church was in all Ages in peaceable poſſeſſion of this prerogative of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, as he do's, <hi>pag.</hi> 76. is a wide miſtake, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53284:148"/>as he aſſerts it without proof, he muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a bare denial for an anſwer, while we leave him to look after any pertinent teſtimony of the Fathers of the firſt three hundred, nay for a thouſand years for his purpoſe; which he ſhall never find.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh Chapter of his Book, p. 102. he falls abruptly upon the old armory of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in favor of his Church. Of this I could not but wonder, having ſeen him, p. 81. engage his whole Logic againſt the power of Miracles, for breeding in men a ſaving divine Faith; <hi>for</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Either they are only probable, or evident; if probable only, they are not proportionable to give us that certainty required for divine Faith, if evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent abſolutely, they can be no motive of Faith which is of its own nature obſcure.</hi> In which piece of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic he gives a clear teſtimony of his Impiety and Ignorance; Impiety in pretending to weaken that ſtrong foundation of Chriſtian Belief, taken from the glory of Miracles, for which I remit him to what he alledges himſelf from the foreſaid p. 102. Ignorance, in pretending that an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Concluſion may not be deduced from an evident Premiſe. To prove <hi>notum per ignotius,</hi> a Concluſion clear by a Premiſe or <hi>Medium</hi> more obſcure, is a known fault in arguing; but to prove by an evident <hi>Medium</hi> a Concluſion obſcure, is a fault of arguing never heard of yet before Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his Logic. By this Canon he makes the belief of <hi>Martha</hi> to be indiſcreet, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſurrection of her brother, and other Miracles our Saviour wrought, concluded, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive that thou art Chriſt the ſon of God.</hi> The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53284:149"/>was evident, but the generation of Chriſt from his heavenly Father, obſcure; <hi>And who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> Eſa. III. 8. Having thus helped him againſt himſelf, for rendring Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles a congruous way to find out true Religion, I gladly accept the challenge to a trial of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by them. Our Religion, or the object of our neceſſary Belief, is only what is contained in the word of God by Canonical Scripture. In favor of this Belief, we have all the Miracles written in the Old and New Teſtament. Their Religion as oppoſite to ours, and differing from us, are thoſe Articles in debate, introduced by the Roman Church, Tranſubſtantiation, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Worſhip of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Will he for ſhame pretend the ſtock of Romanies produced by them for theſe Innovations, fit to be compared with the ſtore of glorious Miracles which we have in the behalf of our divine, truly infallible Belief, contained in holy Scripture? While we ſhow his new Belief to be contrary to this divine Faith, confirmed with Miracles of infallible truth, as we do, let him keep to himſelf his new-coin'd wonders, and remember that God is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to himſelf, in putting his Seal to contrary Laws. And if he muſt believe ſome of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he propoſes, let <hi>Leſſius</hi> and others help him to underſtand what to make of thoſe miracles or wonders which <hi>Valerius Maximus, Titus Livius,</hi> and other Roman Hiſtorians do relate to have bin wrought in favor of their Temples, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Superſtitions: and let him not expect from me, that I ſhould beſtow time in examining the truth or falſe-hood of all his impertinent Allegations.</p>

In the ſame ſeventh Chapter from p. 126. he faſtens on me two notorious calumnies; firſt, that having left the Roman Church, I fixed upon no other to be of; the ſecond, that I ſaid none may be ſaved in the Roman Church. The falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the firſt is ſeen by my public declaration for the Church of <hi>England;</hi> the untruth of the other I declared in the ſecond Chapter of this Treatiſe, whereby all his verboſity upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, appears a fret of his Malice, without any real ground, without ſhame to tax me often with, and repete with his frivolous exclamations, without ſhewing where or when I did ſay, what indeed I never ſaid or wrote, <hi>That there is no ſalvation in the Roman Catholic Religion.</hi> With the ſame confidence, and the like untruth, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petes, That it is the conſtant doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the Romiſh Religion is a ſaving Religion, or a ſafe way to ſalvation; which is what we deny them.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader reflect upon what I ſaid in the foreſaid ſecond Chapter of this Treatiſe, and ſee the confuſion of this mans brains, in not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or delivering diſtinctly our ſentiments, according to our own expreſſions; or the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his mind, in deceiving wilfully his Reader, eſpecially that he himſelf, p. 133. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> comparing both Churches, the Romiſh to a <hi>leaky Ship,</hi> wherein a man may be ſaved, but with great danger and difficulties: and the Proteſtant to a <hi>ſound Ship,</hi> wherein one may be ſaved without hazard. This is the utmoſt of courteſy or charity that may be, and is extended to them? Is this to ſay the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53284:150"/>Church is a ſafe way to ſalſation? Is it ſafe to venture in a leaky Ship upon a ſtormy Sea?

Is Idolatry of thoſe <hi>pious opinions</hi> which matter not for ſalvation? And let Mr. <hi>I.S.</hi> know, that I conſidered long, and examined throughly the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> before I declared for it, and he may ſpare his labour of catechizing me in the Tenets of it.</p>

                  </note> following therein the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Fathers, and Scholemen, that the <hi>points Fundamental,</hi> or of neceſſary belief to Salvation, and to the conſtitution of a true Chriſtian Church, are thoſe contained in the Apoſtles Creed; which is a ſyſtem or ſummary of Articles, which thoſe ſacred Founders of Chriſtianity thought fit and ſufficient to be propoſed to all men, where the Goſpel was preached, and neceſſary to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly believed. So as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> calls it <hi>Fundamentum firmum &amp; unicum,</hi> Seſſ. 3. not the firm alone, but the only Foundation. <hi>Points not Fundamental,</hi> or inferior truths, are all other divine Verities contained in the Word of God, whether written in Canonical Scripture, or delivered to us by Apoſtolical Univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, implicitly contained in the Creed, where we profeſs to believe in God, and in the Catholic Church; and explicitly to be believed when we ſhould be aſcertained that they are contained in thoſe Oracles of God; called inferior truths, not that they are of leſs certainty, and objective Infallibility in themſelves, then the other called <hi>Fundamental;</hi> but becauſe the explicit know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of them is not ſo neceſſary or obvious to all men, and conſequently are more capable of inculpable ignorance of them, and errors about
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53284:151"/>them in many men. And becauſe the Roman Church do's agree with us in the explicit confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Creed, it is ſaid not to err in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points, tho found guilty of pernicious errors touching other points not Fundamental. And with this Suppoſition, I am confident my Antagoniſt will not quarrel, if you take him here, before he ſees my reflexions upon his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Argument.</p>
               <p>Upon the foreſaid Foundation, Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> builds this Theſis, <hi>That the Proteſtant Church, as it is condiſtinct from the Popiſh Church, is not the Church of Chriſt, becauſe, ſaies he, it do's not teach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, and no Church can be called of Chriſt further then it teacheth his doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Proteſtancy, or the doctrine of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as oppoſite to the Popiſh, is not the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, he undertakes to prove with this Syllogiſm, <hi>No fallible doctrine is the doctrine of Chriſt: but Proteſtancy is altogether fallible do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; Therefore Proteſtancy, as it is properly the doctrine of the Proteſtant Church, is not the doctrine of Chriſt.</hi> This Syllogiſm he chalks out to us in a different Character, for remarkable, as indeed it is, and for unanſwerable, for it is in <hi>Ferio,</hi> ſaies he, pag. 142. The Major Propoſition we allow wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; the Minor, to wit, <hi>that Proteſtancy is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fallible doctrine,</hi> he ſaies, is manifeſt by virtue of this other no leſs remarkable Syllogiſm, <hi>Proteſtancy, or the doctrine wherein Proteſtants do differ from Papiſts, is altogether of points not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental: but the doctrine of points not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or inferior truths, is fallible doctrine: therefore Proteſtancy is but fallible doctrine, and therefore no doctrine of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53284:152"/>
He concludes with theſe words, <hi>I confeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, I think this Argument cannot be ſolidly anſwer'd.</hi> If his confeſſion herein be ingenuous indeed, let him take in return this other ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confeſſion from me, that I think ſeriouſly he is a very weak man. If he be ſenſible himſelf of the fallacy and falſehood of his Argument, he is unworthy in beguiling his Reader, and unwiſe in expoſing it to a polemical ſtrict debate: and thinking we ſhould want a ſolid Anſwer to ſo ſilly a Sophiſm, not to give it yet a more ſevere check, haply he has that poor excuſe in his favor, that he knows not what he ſaies.</p>
               <p>To ſee whether my Anſwer be ſolid, let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how ſolid his Argument is. The ſtreſs of it lies in his latter Syllogiſm, whoſe major Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is, <hi>That Proteſtancy, or the doctrine wherein Proteſtants do differ from Papiſts, is altogether of Points not Fundamental.</hi> This we allow him to take for granted. Let us proceed to the Minor, <hi>But the doctrine of Points not Fundamental, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Truths,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>is fallible doctrine.</hi> Stop here Sir, and if Juſtice were don to you, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſtop ſhould be put to your tongue, for blaſphemons, from ſpeaking any more. It is a formal Blaſphemy, and a horrid one to ſay, that the doctrine of Points not Fundamental, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Truths in general is fallible doctrine. It is to ſay, that the Word of God is fallible. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what is premis'd a little before, and ſuppoſed by your ſelf in many places of your preſent diſcourſe, that the Points called not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, are all thoſe other divine Verities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Word of God, whether written in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53284:152"/>Canonical Scripture, or deliver'd to us by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Tradition, beſides the Points contained in the Creed; of equal objective certainty and truth with the other Points. They are of a ſize, as you ſpeak, all being the Word of God, tho not in the ſame degree of neceſſity to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly believed by all men. Therefore to ſay that the doctrine of Points not Fundamental is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, is to ſay, that the Word of God is fallible, which, without Controverſy, is a formal Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Poor Logician, is this your Argument in <hi>Ferio,</hi> for which you thought a ſolid Anſwer could not be found? For a Syllogiſm in <hi>Feri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Premiſes muſt be allowed; and will you have us allow your Premiſes, when one of them is found to be a formal Blaſphemy?</p>
               <p>But it ſeems this horrible Blaſphemy did not fall from him unawares; it was with delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He goes to prove it, and ſee how. The Church can err, and is fallible in Points not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, therefore theſe Points are fallible. This is another goodly piece of Logic, which proves that Points Fundamental are likewiſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. Men can err, and have erred in Points Fundamental, therefore theſe alſo are fallible in your Dialect. This is not to diſtinguiſh Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive fallibility, from the Objective; to paſs the imperfections of the faculty upon the object. Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> looks upon the Sun with ſquint, or dim eies, therefore the Sun is dim or ſquint. The Pope can err, and is fallible in declaring the Word of God, therefore the Word of God is fallible. Your brethren of <hi>Clermont</hi> Colledg, who defended in their Theſes, mentioned chap. 6.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53284:153"/>that the Pope hath the ſame Infallibility which Chriſt had, may think that conſequence legal, The Pope is fallible about the Word of God, therefore the Word of God is fallible, becauſe the Pope hath the very ſame Infallibility which Chriſt the very Word of God hath. But we that a low no ſuch Equality of truth to men, cannot take fallibility in the Word of God, for a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of mans fallibility about it.</p>
               <p>From the foreſaid Poſition, you proceed to the ſecond grand Theſis prefixed to your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <hi>That Proteſtants cannot without Blaſphemy alledg Scripture for their Tenets.</hi> This is ſure a rare ſhew of your wit, a product of your own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never heard of before. I confeſs to have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard the like: and thus you go to prove it. Proteſtancy, or the points wherein Proteſtants do differ from Papiſts, is but a parcel of fallible doctrine, but no fallible doctrine can without Blaſphemy be ſought for in Scripture; therefore Proteſtants cannot without Blaſphemy alledg Scripture for their Tenets. Make of the Major what you pleaſe for the preſent: what deſperate Propoſition is that of the Minor, <hi>That no fallible doctrine may without Blaſphemy be ſought for in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?</hi> By this all the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, all Divines that alledg Scripture for their ſeveral opinions, which they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be infallible, nor more then probable opinions, are guilty of Blaſphemy in your eſteem.</p>
               <p>But that this ſo much ſolemnized Argument may not be altogether uſeleſs, I will retort it upon your ſelf with more force and leſs cavil; proving by it, that your Church is not the Church of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53284:153"/>Chriſt. And thus I argue for it in your own terms. No Church is any further the Church of Chriſt, then as it teacheth the doctrine of Chriſt; but the Roman Church, as condiſtinct from the Reformed Proteſtant Church, or in as much as it differs from it, doth not teach the doctrine of Chriſt; therefore the Roman Church as condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Reformed Proteſtant Church, is not the Church of Chriſt. The Minor Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the Roman Church, as condiſtinct from the Proteſtant Church, doth not teach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, I prove thus: The doctrine which the Roman Church, as condiſtinct from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, and oppoſite to it doth teach, is, Popes Infallibility, and Supremacy over all the Chriſtian Church, Tranſubſtantiation, Worſhip of Images, Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, Indulgences, half Communion, Liturgy in an unknown tongue, prohibiting the people to read holy Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which I have declared in my former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, not to be the doctrine of Chriſt, but all contrary to it, and in this preſent Treatiſe will more fully declare the ſame: Therefore the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church as condiſtinct from the Proteſtant, and oppoſite to it, doth not teach the doctrine of Chriſt, and conſequently is not the Church of Chriſt.</p>

This was the Argument of Pagans, to ſtop the preaching of the Goſpel; more improperly, and with leſs ground uſed by you. Our Religion is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and yours the New, as we prove. Where was our Religion, ſay you, before <hi>Luther?</hi> A queſtion which for one too old ſhould be caſt away. We anſwer, where yours never was; in the Word of God, and in the true Records of Primitive Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>You conclude your heterogeneous Chapter, and your firſt part of your Book, with mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Treatiſe or Paper I penned ſome years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, in favor of the Salvation of Proteſtants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your vulgar Teachers, damning all to hell for Heretics, without reſerve or diſtinction. You ſay the doctrine I delivered was true; but it was indiſcretion to declare it in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whither I was ſent to convert Proteſtants. The caſe was with Papiſts, who concerned for the Salvation of their Relations and Friends of the Proteſtant
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53284:155"/>Communion, enquired, whether ſuch believing ſincerely they were in the right, never convinced of the contrary, and living religiouſly in the fear of God, and in the obſervation of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, might be ſaved. I anſwered they might, and were not Heretics, but Members of the Catholic Church, a dignity received in their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and not to be loſt otherwiſe, then by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Hereſy or Infidelity, whereof they were not guilty by the foreſaid Suppoſition. You ſay all is true, but 'tis not diſcretion to declare truth it ſelf, when there is no obligation of declaring it. Well, but was there not an obligation upon me, when queſtion'd to anſwer according to truth? No, ſay you, <hi>for if the Inquirers were Papiſts, they needed not to be inſtructed in that truth; 'tis no Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truth. If Proteſtants; they were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to know it for the ſame reaſon, and that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was an encouragement to them to remain as they were.</hi> A pretty ſubtilty. We have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, how touching Points not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, there may be pernicious errors. Such is that oppoſite to the Truth we now ſpeak of: an error ſubverſive of Chriſtian charity, and public peace; a ſeed of thoſe Animoſities, Rebellion, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions which made this Land unhappy. And ought not a ſincere Inſtructor, and faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Word of God, to oppoſe this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? No, ſay you, becauſe it was to encourage Proteſtants to remain as they were, and not to come under the Popes Obedience. There is the ground of your diſlike of me.</p>
               <p>Thus indeed ſtood the caſe: and this was one of my chief reaſons to be diſſatisfied of your
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53284:155"/>way, That the rule of my doctrine among you muſt not be truth, but the intereſt of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the increaſe of his Dominion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by right or wrong. This point of policy or diſcretion, as you call it, I refuſed openly to learn from you, chuſing rather to be of the <hi>Children of Light,</hi> tho with leſs prudence in your opinion, then of the <hi>Children of this World,</hi> by that eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted point of prudence you would teach me, of proſtituting truth and honeſty to the Popes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and intereſt.</p>

               <p>OUR Adverſary fore-ſeeing what ſmall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance he could have from Scripture and reaſon to maintain his Tenets, emploies his main forces in ſetting up their ordinary great engine of the Popes Infallibility: and having beſtowed the far greater part of his Book upon that ſubject, turns to it again, beginning the ſecond part of his ſaid Book with reflexions upon ſome of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt their pretention: and wanting, it ſeems, materials to bring his Book to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bulk, repotes much of what he ſaid before: wherein I will not imitate him by repeting my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, my deſire being to abbreviate, as far as may conſiſt with a full ſatisfaction to all his Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>He pretends to caſt a miſt over the caſe, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſual term of Popes Infallibility, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church, and by <hi>Church</hi> he means fraudulently not the Church Univerſal truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic and Apoſtolic, (to which I allow all the priviledges and aſſiſtances of the Holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to it in Scripture, tho he ſignifies that he doubts of my meaning herein) but his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church; I do not mean the Dioceſs of

                  <hi>Rome</hi> (as he do's wilfully impoſe upon me, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to gain time, or draw us from the point) but the Congregation ſubject to the Pope whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever extant. Defenders of a bad cauſe do love ſuch confuſion and obſcurities, as Foxes holes, and thickets; but we muſt keep him to the Light, and to the ordinary uſe of terms, taking for Popes Infallibility the ſame which he, or any of his Communion attributes to their Church depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the Pope, as is declared above in the beginning of the fifth Chapter.</p>
               <p>I ſaid I admired that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhould make it an Argument of the Popes Infallibility, that the high Prieſt did bear in his Breaſt-plate two Hebrew words, ſignifying <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> I queſtioned whether he believed all thoſe high Prieſts, even <hi>Caiphas</hi> condemning Chriſt, to be infallible in their judgments. Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> endeavors to autorize the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, and to that of <hi>Caiphas</hi> ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es nothing, and ſo gives us leave to think that he held him alſo infallible, according to that rule, <hi>qui tacet conſentire videtur.</hi> By which we have this further notice of Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his ſingular doctrine, that he finds <hi>Caiphas</hi> infallible in his judgment paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the life of our Saviour, and taxes me with ignorance for not knowing ſo much.</p>
               <p>I accuſed them of making the Pope Arbiter and ſupreme Judg over Gods Laws. So <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Rom. Pont. c.</hi> 5. ſticketh not to ſay, <hi>That if the Pope did command Vices, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit Virtues, the Church would be obliged to believe Vice to be good, and Virtue bad.</hi> And the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> commanded the Decrees of Popes to be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53284:157"/>preferr'd before the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, ſince having confeſſed that our Saviour did ordain the Communion under both kinds to the Laity, and that the Apoſtles did practice it, they command it ſhould be given for the future but in one kind, alledging for reaſon, that the precedent Popes and Church did practice it ſo. Which is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol the Decrees of Popes, above them of Chriſt. As, if the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood or practiced in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but according to the will and declaration of the King of <hi>France,</hi> certainly the King of <hi>France</hi> would be deemed of more power in <hi>Ireland,</hi> then the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the People more his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>To that of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> you ſay, he ſpoke of <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Virtues</hi> when there is a doubt of their being ſuch; for example, if there ſhould ariſe a doubt of Uſury's being a Vice, and in that caſe the Pope ſhould command Uſury to be practiced, we ſhould be obliged to practice Uſury. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sir you allow us all that we pretended, and you confeſs what we condemned in <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> I could alledg many Texts of Scripture, ſuppoſing and affirming Uſury to be a Vice. But you ſpare me that labour, preſuppoſing, <hi>that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury of it ſelf is a Vice of its nature bad, (Per ſe malum,)</hi> and that you all know it to be ſuch; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that knowledg, and Gods declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture, you ſay if the Pope ſhould command Uſury to be practiced, we ſhould be obliged to practice it. And ſo it is indeed with you both in Uſury and other Vices. We know all that Rebellion is a ſin, and ſoodious to God, that in Scripture it is compared to Witchcraft
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53284:157"/>and Idolatry, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 23. But if the Pope ſhould command you to rebel againſt your King for Religions ſake (forſooth,) then would you be obliged to rebel againſt him; becauſe (ſay you, with <hi>Bellarmin</hi>) <hi>in dubious Caſes the Church is obliged to obey the Pope.</hi> Men are apt to doubt of their duties, and the Devil is ready to ſtir ſuch doubts in them. Thus he wrought the firſt Rebellion in Paradiſe, <hi>Cur praecepit vobis Deus, &amp;c.</hi> Why hath God ſaid ye ſhall not eat of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tree of the Garden? And if the Pope comes out declaring, that it is lawful and religious to rebel, you muſt practice accordingly: tho Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and reaſon makes you know, that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is an heinous vice. This is the great power of the Pope you teach, to metamorphoſe vice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to virtues, and virtues to vices. It is a common boaſt of your ſtout Bigots to ſay, that if the Pope did prohibit them to ſay the Lords Praier, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> they would not ſay it, tho Chriſt did order them to pray ſo.</p>
               <p>To that of the Council of <hi>Conſtarce,</hi> you ſay, it is falſe, that they alledged no other reaſon for prohibiting the Cup to the Laity, then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of precedent Popes. You affirm, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged alſo for reaſon, the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who gave it in one kind: whereby it appears you did not read the Council. Read the thirteenth Seſſion of it, where this matter is handled, and there you ſhall find no montion of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to have given the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in one kind; but the contrary is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as appears by theſe words of the Decree, <hi>Quod licet in Primitiva Eccleſia hujuſmodi Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53284:158"/>reciperetur à fidelibus ſub utraque ſpecie, poſtea à conficientibus ſub utraque, &amp; à Laicis tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tummodo ſub ſpecie panis ſuſcipiatur.</hi> 
                  <q>That tho the Sacrament of Communion in the Primitive Church was received by the faithful under both kinds, for the future it is to be received by the Prieſts conſecrating under both kinds, and by the Laity only under the Species of Bread.</q> It is therefore from your ſelf you ſay, that Chriſt and the Apoſtles did adminiſter it to the Laity under one kind, and the Council do's not pretend to know ſo much, only alledges the cuſtom formerly introduced, ſaying, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde cum hujuſmodi conſuetudo ab Eccleſia &amp; Sanctis patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus rationabiliter introducta &amp; diutiſſime obſervata ſit, habenda eſt pro lege.</hi> 
                  <q>That this cuſtom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſonably introduced, and long time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Church and holy Fathers, it is to be taken for a Law.</q> Here you ſee no mention made of Chriſt or the Apoſtles to have don ſo, as you ſay. Upon what ground, you do not tell us; you will have it taken upon your credit.</p>
               <p>By ſaying that I may flatter the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by telling him, he hath more power in this Kingdom then the King his Maſter, in whoſe place and name he acts, becauſe I accuſed you of giving more power to the Pope then to God, by theſe priviledges of giving to divine Law what ſenſe he pleaſes, and overthrowing the Ordinances of Chriſt to ſet up his own; by this your expreſſion, I ſay, you are twice criminal in a hainous degree. Firſt, for imagining it ſhould be a way to flatter my Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to ſay, he had more power in <hi>Ireland</hi> then
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53284:158"/>the Kings Majeſty, which he could not hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror and indignation. Secondly, for the falſehood of your ſuppoſition to frame your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. When or where did the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſay, that notwithſtanding the King of <hi>England</hi> did ordain this, or that, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ireland,</hi> himſelf would order the contrary; as your pretended Vicar of Chriſt ſaid in the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> now mention'd, that notwithſtanding Chriſt did order the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to be given in both kinds to the Laity, he did order himſelf the contrary? And all this ſenſeleſs and groundleſs extravagancy you run upon, only to find occaſion of talking to us of a halter, after your wonted grave and modeſt ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>le. But being convinced of a falſe accuſation, you deſerve, by the law of retaliation, the puniſhment due to the crime you do ſo falſly impoſe upon us. Certainly that of the ducking-ſtool will appear in all good judgments both due and neceſſary to ſo foul a mouth.</p>
               <p>Another Example. I produced of your extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Papal Laws above the Divine, in the caſe of <hi>Coſterus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Its a greater ſin in a Prieſt to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then to keep a Concubine,</hi> the former being but a tranſgreſſion of a Papal Law, the ſecond of a Divine. You anſwer, p. 173. that tho it be but a Papal Law, that Prieſts ſhould vow chaſtity, yet the vow being made, it is a trangreſſion of Divine Law to violate it. Conſult your Caſuiſts Sir, and you ſhall find them all ſay, that a vow made in any matter oppoſite to Gods orders, is null or invalid. There is an order of God inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the unmarried, <hi>that if they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53284:159"/>cannot contain, let them marry,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.9. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is, that a Prieſt ſhould find by experience, that he cannot contain. This you will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Then the vow appears to be null, becauſe by it was promiſed a thing contrary to that order of God intimated by St. <hi>Paul:</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the obligation of it ceaſeth; only the Popes Law prohibiting Prieſts to marry urgeth. To it is oppoſite that other intimated to the unmarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>if they cannot contain, let them marry.</hi> Which of theſe Laws or Orders muſt be obſerved? If you ſay the Popes Law, as <hi>Coſterus</hi> do's; then follows the Concluſion, that you prefer the Popes Laws to thoſe of God. You may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim at this; but you ſee the Premiſes contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them the Concluſion, is inbred undenied doctrine among you.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I accuſed our Adverſaries of a Circle commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their pretence to Infallibility, becauſe they prove it by Scripture, and the Infallibility of Scripture they prove by the infallibility of their Church, which is to go ſtill round in a Circle. Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> to wind himſelf out of this Circle, preſents to us a reſolution of his Faith, containing in it a greater Circle, or many Circles together. Having premiſed ſome trivial notions to ching the obſcurity of Faith, and evidence of credibility required to the aſſent of it, he falls on extolling the power and aptneſs of Miracles to beget ſuch credibility, reducing all to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Roman Church, authorized with Miracles, as he pretends: and from page 180. he enters into his reſolution of Faith thus. <q>You ask why I beleive the Trinity? I anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath revealed it. You ask why I believe that God revealed it? I anſwer, becauſe the Church by which God ſpeaks tells us ſo. You ask why I beleive that God ſpeaks by the Church? I muſt not anſwer becauſe the Scripture ſays it; neither muſt I anſwer, that I beleive God to ſpeak by the Church, becauſe ſhe works Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:53284:160"/>
Here I am to doubt whether this be the ſame man that ſpoke to us a little before, p. 177. and more at large, p. 102. extolling the force of Miracles to beget an evidence of Credibility in the propoſer of divine Verities; or another of his Auxiliaries, that came in his place to carry on the work, without regard to what the former ſaid. But whoever he be, let us ſee how he diſputes againſt Miracles: <hi>If the Miracles be abſolutely evident,</hi> ſays he, <hi>they can be no motive of Faith, which is of its own nature obſcure: and if they be but morally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Miracles, they can not be the motive, becauſe the motive of Faith muſt be infallible.</hi> How blind is the attemt of this Man againſt Miracles? how deſtructive of his own purpoſe? How abſurd and ridiculous his argument againſt Miracles, I have declared above in Chap. 9. whither I remitt the Reader. Now let us ſee this myſterious work of our Adverſary go on. Having excluded Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles from aſcertaining us of the credibility of the Church propoſing doctrines to us, he tells us how we muſt anſwer that queſtion, <hi>Why I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive that God ſpeaks by the Church:</hi> and it muſt be thus, <hi>becauſe the Church, by which God ſpeaks, ſays that God ſpeaks by her, and I am obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive be ſpeaks by her, becauſe he doth credit her with ſo many Miracles, and ſupernatural marks, which makes it evidently credible, that he doth ſpeak by her.</hi> If it be the ſame Man that wrote the whole page, it cannot but appear a wonder, that having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his skill a few lines before, in weakning the force of Miracles to ground the infallibility of the Church on, he ſhould now take up the ſame Miracles for his ultimate reaſon of beleiving in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53284:160"/>Church. As a nice Man, who throwing away the paring of his apple, and checking his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for eating his without paring, fell immediatly after upon eating the paring he threw away.</p>
               <p>To caſt a patch upon this foul breach of cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in reaſoning, our Adverſary ſhuffles in a diſtinction betwixt the motive of our act of Faith, and the motive of our obligation of beleiving, which indeed is nothing elſe at the preſent then <hi>Culicem excoriare,</hi> to flay a flea, after much ado to do nothing. The preſent queſtion immediatly propoſed is, <hi>why am I to beleive that God ſpeaks by the Church?</hi> the only reaſon he gives for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving in the Church, is Miracles. What needs that diſtinction of motive to my beleif, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to my acknowledgment of obligation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive? the ſame reaſon that makes me beleive, intimates to me my obligation of beleiving. The primitive Chriſtians who heard the Apoſtles preach, and ſaw their Miracles, knew nothing of theſe diſtinctions. Seing thoſe Servants of God confirm their doctrine with Miracles, they beleived God ſpake by them, and for the ſame reaſon or motive thought themſelves obliged to beleive them. If we have the ſame Faith that the primitive Chriſtians of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> had, as Mr. I. S. ſays, p. 183. why ſhall not we go the ſame way to beleive as they did?</p>
               <p>But our Adverſary is upon a deſign of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon us a Faith which the Apoſtles did not teach, which he diſcovers clearly (tho hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily not ſo much to his own knowledg) p. 184. in thoſe remarkable words: <hi>The cheif and laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, whereupon our Faith muſt reſt, is the Word of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53284:161"/>God ſpeaking to us by the Church. The Church, I ſay, by which God actually in this preſent Age ſpeaks unto us; for we do not beleive becauſe God did ſpeak in the firſt, ſecond or third Age by the Church,</hi> &amp;c. Here you ſee, Reader, a plain Confeſſion of the great guilt of the Roman Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the moſt ſevere reſentment of all true Chriſtians, that glorious, truly Catholic, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic and holy Church of the primitive Ages excluded from the office of being Miſtreſs of our beleif, and the Church of this corrupt Age, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the moſt corrupt Court in the World (if we are to beleive them that are beſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it) that of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſubſtituted in her place: And as this is propoſed by our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary without any proof, ſo it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by all true Chriſtians with indignation.</p>
               <p>Only I will reflect upon the inconſequence of the Man, and how farr he is from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ridding himſelf from a Circle in reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Faith. All that great Labyrinth he works from p. 176. to p. 184. in order to declare his procedure to each act of Faith, and able to puzzle the beſt underſtanding, will certainly be requiſite in his opinion to proceed to this laſt act of Faith, which he will have to be the guide of all others, <hi>that the Roman Church of this Age is infallible in teaching what we ought to beleive.</hi> This being, as he ſays, an act of divine Faith, I mean, that the Pope with a Generall Council, ſuch as that of <hi>Trent,</hi> is infallible in propoſing matters of Faith, how ſhall he go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to reſolve his Faith upon this particular point? Certainly thus, according to his former
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53284:161"/>diſcourſe: I beleive that the preſent Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> is infallible, and God ſpeaks by her, <hi>becauſe the Church by which God ſpeaks, ſays, that God ſpeaks by her, and I am obliged to beleive that God ſpeaks by her, becauſe he credits her by ſo many Miracles, and ſupernaturall marks, which makes it evidently credible that he doth ſpeak by her.</hi> Theſe are Mr. I. S. his own words, and his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith ſet down in the 181. page of his Book. And while the Reader reckons how many Circles he committs here, endeavouring to rid himſelf of one, I ask of him where be thoſe Miracles wrought by the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Popes moderating in it, to breed in me an evidence of credibility that God ſpake by their mouth, as the Chriſtians of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> ſaw the Apoſtles work for believing that God ſpake by them; being he ſays I muſt take the objects of Faith upon credit of the preſent Church, and that credit muſt be grounded upon Miracles and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall marks appearing for it? Will he have us prefer his forg'd Miracles in favour of his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coin'd-Faith, to thoſe wrought by the Apoſtles in confirmation of the Faith preached by them? Turn, Reader, to what I ſaid to this purpoſe in the 9. Chapter of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>The more I conſider this reſolution of Mr. I. S. his Faith, the leſs I find in it of reſolution, and the more Circles and obſcurities. Now I enquire of him further, why doth he exclude the Church of the firſt, ſecond, and third Age from the office of declaring Gods will and word to us?
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53284:162"/>He anſwers, becauſe the declarations of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church are known to us onely by tradition, and <hi>tradition,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is not the motive, but the Rule of our belief.</hi> All this he muſt ſay of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or the Church repreſented in it of this Age; that alone, and not the Pope out of it, muſt be in his doctrine our infallible Teacher. Now further, Is not the doctrin of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> propoſed to us as a Rule of our Faith of equal value and autority with the written word of God, both proceeding from the Holy Ghoſt? they ſay it is: Is not more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that doctrine known to us only by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? certainly it is. I have no notice of it, nor can I have but by relation of others, and they of no more credit with me, but rather of far leſs, then thoſe Venerable Writers that relate to us the doctrine of the primitive Church. Are there not Controverſies dayly, and endleſs about the ſenſe and meaning of the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> as well as about the more ancient Councils? witneſs the diſmall broyls betwixt Jeſuiſts, Janſeniſts, and Dominicans. Where is now Mr. I. S. his living infallible Judg? The Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Popes governing it, are dead and gon. The Pope now living, or any Councill he can congregate, leſs than a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral one, is not an infallible Judg. Who then will aſcertain him? will he have a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill congregated for the reſolution of his Faith in every doubt that comes into his head?</p>
               <p>How ſhall we be ſure that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> did not err in their definition of the great debate with the <hi>Janſeniſts?</hi> Their definition
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53284:162"/>not being in a general Council cannot be to us a warrant of ſecurity in Mr. I. S. his opinion. The Janſeniſts will triumph at this: and will that pleaſe them at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Paris?</hi> while Mr. I. S. agrees with them upon this particular, I ask further. Tho a General Council were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated now to that effect, ſuch as that of <hi>Trent,</hi> to aſcertain us of the Articles defined againſt <hi>Janſenius,</hi> how ſhall I be ſure that God ſpeaks by ſuch a Council, or the Church repreſented in it? thus in Mr. I. S. his dialect: <hi>becauſe the Church by which God ſpeaks ſays that God ſpeaks by her, becauſe he doth credit her by ſo many Miracles and ſupernatural marks, which makes it evidently credible, that he doth ſpeak by her.</hi> Well, and where be thoſe Miracles and ſupernatural marks aſſiſting this Council preſent, to aſcertain us that God ſpeaks by it? are you ſure to find them at hand when the Council is joined? likely you are upon the experience of coining Miracles, when occaſion requires it.</p>
               <p>By this, Reader, you may ſee how little Mr. I. S. hath don, after ſo much ado, to reſolve his Faith without a Circle. How raſh his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was, that Proteſtants will never reſolve theirs without ſuch a fault, I will now ſhew briefly. The Faith of Proteſtants is that contain'd in Canonical Scripture, as he often ſuppoſes; my Faith touching each point of thoſe contained in Scripture, I reſolve thus. I believe the Son of God was made Man, becauſe I find it written in the holy Scripture. I believe what is written in the holy Scripture, becauſe it is the infallible Word of God. And I believe it is the Word of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53284:163"/>God becauſe the Apoſtles preaching it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it with ſuch Miracles and Wonders as only God could work. And finally that the Apoſtles did deliver the Doctrine contained in Scripture, and did confirm it with Miracles, I beleive in force of univerſal tradition, according to that celebrated notion of it, delivered by <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis, quod ubique, quod ſemper, quod apud omnes eſt creditum;</hi> what was alwaies, in all places, and by all Chriſtians received and believed, is to be taken for Univerſal and Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. This common conſent of Chriſtians making up univerſal Tradition we have in what is unanimouſly delivered by the ancient Fathers, and declared in the firſt general Councils of thoſe more holy and ſincere primitive times. Thither I go to take up my belief, as to ſtreams immediatly proceeding from the Fountain of Grace, with more pleaſure and ſatisfaction, then to the muddy Waters of doctrine delivered by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of this corrupt Age, paſt through ſo many hands defiled with ambition, avarice, and other earthly paſſions repugnant to ſincerity: of which we have too much aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is a Providence of God, and the great force of truth, that our Adverſaries ſhould forget themſelves ſometimes, and diſcover their wicked intentions, covered under ſacred pretexts. All their Novelties they frequently ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the venerable cloak of Antiquity. It is a glory of humility, ſays S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> that Pride ſhould wear a cloak of it, to be in eſteem: <hi>Glorioſa res humilitas qua ſe veſtire ſolet Superbia ne evileſcat;</hi> and ſo it is a glory of Antiquity that Novellers ſhould pretend credit to their inventions, by caſting on them a color of Antiquity. It is very frequent with the Romaniſts to uſe this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, to cloak their new Decrees with the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name of ancient Canons, to call their Church, ancient Church, tho compoſed of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, where it oppoſes the Reformed. Mr. I. S. hath bin pleaſed to unmask his Church herein to us, declaring that the ultimate ground, and motive of their belief, and their Proſelytes, muſt not be the Teſtimony of that ſacred primitive Church govern'd by Chriſt himſelf, and his bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; but the Teſtimony of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> infected with the corruptions which the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53284:164"/>World knows, and both friends and foes do ſee and cry againſt with univerſal ſcan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t and view the ſweet and comfortable face of primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and willing us only to attend the foul and abominable practices of the Roman Court, calling it ſelf Church, and even the Catholic, Univerſal, and only Church, to the offence and ſcandal of all ſincere and knowing Men; Beſides the perverſity of this Doctrine, the dangerous conſequences of it are much to be conſidered; for preventing the growth of this deſtructive Seed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it followeth hence that as there is no end of Diſputes and Controverſies among Men (nor any is like to be,) ſo there will be no end of coining new Articles of Faith, all tending to the encreaſe of power and ſplendor of the Pope and his Court, tho at the expences of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and deſtructions to Men, Cities, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Kingdoms, as often happen'd. This to be their aim, under the pretence of exalting and propagating the Faith of Chriſt, appears by the next attemt of Mr. I. S. in favor of the Popes ſupremacy, to be examined in the Chapter next following.</p>
               <p>Having eſtabliſhed the Pope, and his preſent Church (as he conceives) in the poſſeſſion of infallible Judges in matters of Faith, the next point he takes in hand to eſtabliſh, as the chiefeſt of his concern, is the Popes ſupremacy, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power over all Chriſtians, directly forfooth
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53284:164"/>ſpirituals, but effectively in their temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; as many powerful Princes, Kingdoms and provinces have experienced to their woe. Theſe two great Prerogatives of abſolute power over all Chriſtians, and of infallibility in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, ſuch as none may oppoſe or mutter againſt, being eſtabliſhed in the Pope, what ſecurity can people or Princes have of their Liberties or Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, if liable to be cenſured Heretics, if they do not receive and ſubmit to any thing the Pope will be pleaſed to decree and declare for an article of Faith, and being thus cenſured, to have their Liberties and Lands ſeiz'd upon, and taken from them, by any that will have force to do it?</p>
               <p>Next we are to conſider the dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this Doctrine in the daily extent of the Popes power and autority, by his Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and flatterers. Hitherto they were contented to aſſert his infallibility in matters of <hi>Right,</hi> now of late they extend it to matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the famous <hi>Theſis</hi> of the Pariſian Jeſuits, declared above in the ninth Chapter. And tho another party oppoſed that aſſertion of theirs, as mentioned in the place aforeſaid, all men know how litle ſucceſs any may expect to have in the Roman Judicature, againſt ſuch as will engage in exalting and extending the power and authority of the Pope, and ſo the Jeſuits have not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a cenſure of hereſy and blaſphemy, &amp;c. agaiſt the Doctrine of <hi>Cornelius Janſenius,</hi> where the debate was in matter of <hi>right,</hi> but another ariſing touching the fact; whether <hi>Janſenius</hi> did indeed deliver ſuch a Doctrine. They obtained
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53284:165"/>wiſe from the ſucceeding Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a Bull and Decree no leſs peremtory, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fact, declaring the ſaid Propoſitions cenſured by his Predeceſſor to be really contain'd in <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Book, and, (which is more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful he ſhould know) in the ſenſe intended by <hi>Janſenius.</hi> The foreſaid ſworn defenders and exalters of the Popes autority have defended publicly, that we are to believe with divine Faith, the ſaid declaration of the Popes againſt <hi>Janſenius,</hi> as well in matter of right as fact, to be infallible, by theſe notable words, <hi>Fide divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ credi poteſt librum cui titulus</hi> Auguſtinus Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii <hi>eſſe haereticum, &amp; quinque Propoſitiones ex eo decerptas eſſe</hi> Janſenii, <hi>&amp; in ſenſu</hi> Janſenii <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natas:</hi> that the Book intitled the <hi>Auguſtin</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is heretical, and the five Propoſitions which are gathered out of it, are <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s, and in the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius</hi> condemned. And there is no reaſon but we may expect a command of believing the Popes infallibility in this latter kind in matter of fact, as formerly intimated in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of right.</p>
               <p>And if this be eſtabliſhed, that the Pope is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible alſo in matters of fact: and if he be pleaſed to declare that any of us in particular is an heretic, or hath delivered an heretical Propoſition, Woe be to him ſo declared a heretic by the Pope. All Chriſtians, ſubject to the Pope, muſt take him for an heretic, and proceed againſt him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with all thoſe ſeverities inflicted by Canons againſt Heretics. Mr. I. S. accuſes me to the Lord Licutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> that I ſhould have ſaid, <hi>that there is no ſalvation in the Catholic hurch:</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:53284:165"/>a propoſition, in my own opinion, heretical and blaſphemous taken in its proper literal and right ſenſe (not to take notice of ſome crooked impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe, which Mr. I. S. may pretend, and may render my diſcourſe obſcure.) This teſtimony ſo evidently falſe he impoſes upon me, my Book being extant in the hands of many hundred men, and my ſelf living to declare the falſe-hood of it yet his confidence is ſuch, that having no evidence, nor as much as attemted, to prove the truth of his accuſation, he will have my Lord Lieutenant to proceed to the utmoſt ſeverity againſt me, commanding me to be burned for blaſphemous. Ill may he expect from his Excellency ſo unjuſt and raſh a judgment: but how far he may ſpeed in <hi>Rome</hi> with the ſame accuſation, tho falſe, I may not know. Of their integrity, proceeding to judgement without hearing the parties, I can have no aſſurance. If they declare me for Author of the Propoſition impoſed upon me by Mr. I. S. <hi>That in the Catholic Church there is no ſalvation,</hi> and conſequently guilty of hereſy and blaſphemy, and all muſt take their declaration therein for infallible, according to that increaſe of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in matters of fact aſcribed of late to the Pope by his prime Favorites: what miſchief may not I expect from all thoſe who think it a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſervice of God to deſtroy Hereties?</p>
               <p>But my particular concern is not of ſo great a force to declare the enormity or danger of this conſequence. He accuſes the whole Church of Proteſtants of hereſy and blaſphemy in a high degree, ſaying its their common doctrine, that it is impoſſible to keep Gods Commandments:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53284:166"/>which propoſition in its literal full ſenſe is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly heretical and blaſphemous, for deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Gods juſtice and goodneſs, and diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to the doctrine of Chriſt, as I have declared in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter; where alſo I have ſhewed how falſely ſuch a doctrine is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the whole Church of <hi>England.</hi> But if our Adverſary gets a definition of the Pope that we are in effect guilty of that error, in what condition ſhall we ſtand with our neighbors? our innocency in the caſe will not availe. What if Mr. I. S. or other like him, would accuſe ſome great Chriſtian Prince of hereſy, tho with as little truth as we have ſeen his accuſation of me, and of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> now mentioned to have proceeded? But if the malice of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, hunting after the Lands of ſuch a Prince, and of his Subjects diſpoſed to rebell againſt him, ſhould join to accuſe him of heretical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and the Pope thereby ſhould proceed to deliver his infallible judgment, touching ſuch a Prince, to be an heretic in effect, in what miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition muſt that Prince be for credit and intereſt, to be taken by all men for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted heretic? his Subjects abſolved from their Allegiance to him, and his Lands expoſed to the prey of any ſtronger hand autorized by the Pope, according to the procedure of that Court, whereof many diſmal Tragedies are to be ſeen in the Chronicles of <hi>England, Germany, Navarre,</hi> and other Kingdoms of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To eſtabliſh this power in the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo deſtructive to the peace and ſafety of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people and Princes, being the aim of Mr.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53284:166"/>I. S. his tedious and intricate diſcourſes, in favor of his pretended unerring, unerrable Church, and that declared by himſelf, he may expect the time, when all Chriſtian people are perfectly blind and mad, to have his doctrine received. And now having ſeen how unſucceſsful he hath bin in ſetting up the grand Engine of the Popes infallibility, or infallibility of the Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Pope (by which name of either he pleaſeth to term it) to put us to ſilence as to further debates, as truly he had need, accordingly he appears ill furniſhed to enter into them. We will now proceed to ſee how ill armed he is to encounter upon the particular points I propoſed for motive of my diſcontent with the Roman Church.</p>

               <p>OUR Adverſary will have us take for an Article of Faith, the Supreme power of the Pope over all Chriſtians in Spiritual affairs. Whether he hath the like ſupreme power over Princes in temporal concerns, he leaves to our diſcretion to believe what we pleaſe, the caſe being diſputable. And indeed it is a courteſy in Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> to permit us this liberty even touching temporal affairs, and beyond commiſſion from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as may appear by what we are to ſay in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>But what he allows him of Supremacy in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual government over all other Biſhops, and over all Chriſtians, is certainly more then his right; more then Chriſt gave him, and more then S. <hi>Peter</hi> had, whoſe Succeſſor the Pope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be.

               <p>Certainly this Ambition of being head of the Univerſal Church, a priviledg granted in Scripture only to Chriſt, the boldneſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring his own laws to the Laws of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we gave ſeveral inſtances, have great affinity with the qualities of Anti-chriſt deſcribed in Scripture. And St. <hi>Gregory</hi> his prediction, that the uſurpation of this Supremacy would be a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity to the Church, is found to be too true. All the Combuſtions and diſmal Contentions that afflicted this Kingdom for a whole Age, did proceed from the Popes pretention to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.

               <p>All this will be made clear to ſuch as will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that our Princes pretend not to any other Supremacy or power over their Subjects, then ſuch as the godly Kings of Iſrael had in their time over the Jews, and the Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the Primitive Church over their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Subjects; as is declared in the thirty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Article, and ſeventh Canon of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and as indeed our Princes do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,

               <p>Neither did our Savior diminiſh, but rather confirm this ſupreme power of Princes over their Subjects.

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Our Adverſarys Eſſay in favour of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation examined. His Challenge for ſolving two Syllogiſms anſwered.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MR. <hi>I. S.</hi> I do generally find you unexact, and much unlike a Scholar in your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but more when you boaſt moſt, and ſtand in defiances. Now you defy all my Divinity to anſwer two Syllogiſms, you would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be of your own invention. But a piece of my Logic will make both appear Paralogiſms unworthy of any anſwer, no formal Syllogiſms. The firſt grounded upon <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.19. <hi>Eat, this is my Body which is given for you,</hi> runs thus; <hi>He gave to them what he gave for them; But what he gave for them, was not a ſigure, but his real and true Body; therefore what he gave to them was not a figure, but his real and true body.</hi> In this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm nothing is new but the form you give it, and that guilty of ſeveral vices againſt the rules of Logic. I ſay nothing is new in your argument, nor any ſenſe or force added to it, by paſſing the caſe from Chriſt giving the laſt Supper, to Chriſt ſuffering upon the Croſs. All your Syllogiſm may be formed in the former caſe as in the latter, thus; What Chriſt gave to his Diſciples at the laſt Supper was the ſame Body they ſaw ſpeaking to them, and giving them the bread; The body they ſaw ſpeaking to them, and giving them
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53284:176"/>the Supper was a real body not a figurative; <hi>Ergo.</hi> Tho you had all the eies of <hi>Argus,</hi> you will never diſcover any ſenſe or force in your new invented Syllogiſm, that is not in this ſo trivial and often anſwered.</p>
               <p>But being you conceive ſome excellency in the form of our Syllogiſm, I will let you ſee ſome perfections of it. Firſt its guilty of that groſs vice in arguing <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> or a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the queſtion. In your <hi>major propoſition</hi> you take for granted that which is conſtantly deny'd to you, <hi>that he gave to them really, and not only figuratively, his fleſh which he gave for them.</hi> If you will not take it ſo, but indeterminatly, touching the mode of giving his Body to them, whether real or figurative; then you fall into another no leſs notorious vice in arguing, called <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ſuppoſiti,</hi> to change the Suppoſition. In the <hi>major propoſition</hi> our Saviors Body ſuppoſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinatly with you, preſcinding from the mode. In the <hi>Minor</hi> it ſuppoſes determinatly, affixing it to a real or corporal mode. Hence appears a third vice in your Syllogiſm of arguing in four terms: taking up in the <hi>Minor</hi> a term which was not in the <hi>Major,</hi> to wit, the mode of giving his Body corporally: and thence you proceed to join or identify in the concluſion terms which you did not ſhew identified in any <hi>medium,</hi> neglecting herein that prime rule of reaſoning, <hi>Quae ſunt eadem uni tertio ſunt eadem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſe.</hi> To argue right and according to this rule, and without the Vices now diſcovered in your Syllogiſm, you ſhould have formed it thus: He gave to them what he gave for them, both
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53284:177"/>in mode and ſubſtance; what he gave for them was his Body not figurative, but real; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave it to them really.</p>
               <p>Thus your Argument would carry the ſhape of a legal Syllogiſm, and your next work was to be the proving of the <hi>major</hi> propoſition; That Chriſt gave to the Diſciples what he gave for them, both in mode and ſubſtance; that which you will never be able to do. You ſay the text makes no diſtinction betwixt what he gave to them, and what he gave for them. But mens eies did. They ſaw given for them upon the Croſs a real organic human body; ſuch they did not ſee given to them at the Supper. You ſay further, not only falſely but blaſphemouſly, that if we ſay what he gave to them was but figurative, we muſt ſay alſo that what he gave for them was only figurative, and ſo fetch from Hell again the hereſy of <hi>Marcion,</hi> that what ſuffered for us was but a fantaſtical body. You are too ready in fetching hereſies from Hell, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the foundations of Chriſtianity upon very light or no occaſion given to you for it. But we are not ſo ready to believe you, or let your raw inferences run without a check. S. <hi>John</hi> that ſaw our Saviour upon the Croſs, the ſame perſon he knew ſo well, how could he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it was a Phantaſm, and not a real Body? to Hell you muſt go for men that would abuſe their ſenſes ſo. And thence certainly came your Paradox of impoſing upon our ſenſes, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Marcion</hi> under other terms, pretending its but a Phantaſm of bread, not a real one, what our ſenſes do aſſure us to be true bread
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53284:177"/>in the Euchariſt. And by this overthrowing the main Pillar of Chriſtian Belief grounded upon the glory of Miracles propoſed to us by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of our ſenſes: and being taught to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe them, a Gate is open for new <hi>Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> to ſay, the reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonders our Saviour and his Apoſtles wrought in confirmation of their doctrine, were but Phantaſms, <hi>praeſtigiae ſenſuum,</hi> ſome Art of <hi>Legerdemain</hi> deluding our ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Finally, by this your Illuſtration of your Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm, you render it a formal Paralogiſm, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his notion of this kind of ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Syllogiſm; which is, (ſaies he, 1. top. c. 1.) <hi>When you aſſume for eviaent what is falſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</hi> And you aſſume for as clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Chriſt was corporally preſent in the bread he gave at the laſt Supper, as it was clear and evident to the beholders of both, that he was corporally upon the Croſs. I have proved with Arguments, which you did not yet, nor ever will ſolve, this your aſſumtion to be both falſe and impoſſible. And while you do not, let it be concluded that your Syllogiſm you magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſo much, is a meer Paralogiſm.</p>
               <p>But for ſuch as may not ſo readily dive into this Logical ſcrutiny of your Sophiſtic Syllogiſm, or Paralogiſm, and to undeceive your ſelf ſo much wedded to your ill digeſted conceptions, I will let you ſee the fallacy and weakneſs of your Argument in another of the very ſame form, grounded upon words of our Saviour alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> XV. 1. <hi>I am the true Vine;</hi> upon which words you may argue thus. Chriſt by his own decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53284:178"/>is a true Vine; but a true Vine is neither God nor man: therefore Chriſt by his own declaration is neither God nor man. This Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm hath the very ſame form which yours hath, and is grounded upon as Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as yours is: no defect can be imagined in it, which appears not in yours. If you do not think it concluding, expect not to have us believe yours to be concluding; and brag not ſo much of your Syllogiſms for unanſwerable, until you anſwer this.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Syllogiſm you pray to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, is upon thoſe words of the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> VI. 52. <hi>How can this Man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> An Argument I propoſed my ſelf more clearly in fewer words, and anſwered very clearly in the pag. 63. of my diſcourſe, which if you did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with ingenuity, you might have ſpared us the labor of ſeeing your work about it. But the force lies in the form you give it, which is this, <hi>A damnal le <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeleiver is he who denies a truth ſufficiently propoſed to him to be revealed by God: the Jews in this occaſion were damnable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeleivers, and what they denied was a fleſhly eating of his real body, as the Papiſts beleive it.</hi> Thus you, p. 189. of your Book.</p>
               <p>In this Syllogiſm I could reckon up as many vices as I did in your former: but I am tired, and may fear to tire my Reader with often mince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your raw Arguments; to condemn it in the judgment of any good Logician is ſufficient to ſhew it. Surely it has nothing of a formal S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm, but that it ſeems to conſiſt of three propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. And at this rate you may make a horſe of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53284:178"/>a ſtool, becauſe both have four feet. But even herein I do your Syllogiſm favor, in allowing, it ſhould ſeem to conſiſt of three Propoſitions, for in truth it hath four, &amp; in them four terms, one of its notorious vices. That which takes place of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor hath two Propoſitions in it; <hi>The Jews in this occaſion were damnable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeleivers, and what they denied was a fleſhly eating of his real Body, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do beleive it.</hi> Where we ſee two diſtinct Propoſitions; the ſecond abruptly intruded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any connexion or affinity with the <hi>medium</hi> placed in the major. And thence you paſs to your third, or rather fourth Propoſition, bearing by <hi>Ergo</hi> or <hi>therefore,</hi> the mark of a Concluſion, but no more. For a Concluſion, indeed ought to be a verity contained in the Premiſes; in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your Premiſes is your Concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, nor in both. What only ſeemeth to have ſome affinity with the Concluſion, is that ſecond part of your Minor, <hi>That what the Jews deny'd, was a Fleſhly eating of his real Body, as the Papiſts do believe:</hi> but tho this be ſo, its far from fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Concluſion, <hi>That Chriſt did ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſe unto them a fleſhly eating of his real Body; as Papiſts do believe it.</hi> For tho they deny'd a fleſhly eating, it was not that only what they denied. They denied alſo a Spiritual eating: they denied a Fleſhly eating, but impertinently to the propoſal of Chriſt. They denied what was not demanded of them, by a miſtake of his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which our Saviour corrected immediately, by ſaying, <hi>Joh.</hi> VI. 63. <hi>The words he ſpoke to them were Spirit and Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You alledg that I acknowledged the Jews to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53284:179"/>have underſtood Chriſt of a Corporal and Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eating, as Papiſts do. But you conceal frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently, how I ſaid, and proved that they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood him, and Chriſt did tax them with a miſ-underſtanding, as now mention'd. Where is now in all this, any even probable ground for your Concluſion, which you pretend to have found out clearly in the foreſaid place of St. <hi>John;</hi> that Chriſt in that occaſion did ſufficiently propoſe to them a Fleſhly eating of his real Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as Papiſts do believe it; that only in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch eating, they were damnable Unbelievers? You affirm decretorially, without giving any reaſon for it, that the words of our Saviour, <hi>The Fleſh profiteth nothing, its the Spirit that quickeneth, &amp;c.</hi> was not a check to the Jews, for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding him of a Fleſhly eating; but to us for judging of this Myſtery by the ſenſes of the Fleſh, and by natural reaſon. Sir, we are ready by the help of divine Grace, to captivate our ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and reaſon to the Obedience of Faith in God, whereſoever we find him declare his Will to us, without any further examen. But ſuch captivity of our underſtanding we do upon good grounds deny to your Decrees, as undue to them. In what the Church of <hi>England</hi> believes, touching the holy Euchariſt, there is a large compaſs for divine Faith to be exerciſed. Its no work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by ſenſe or reaſon, to underſtand or believe ſo ſtrange an Union, tho Spiritual (as the Goſpel tells us, and we believe) 'twixt Chriſt and the faithful Receiver of this Sacrament; ſuch ſtreams of divine Grace, ſuch feeding of Souls to life everlaſting. To this we willingly pay a captivity
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53284:179"/>of our underſtanding, becauſe we find it clearly declared in the Word of God, tho never ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo much the reach of our natural Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. From niceties touching the mode we do religiouſly abſtain, being God was not pleaſed to declare it: according to that grave and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious expreſſion of King <hi>James, Quod legit Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia Anglicana, pie credit; quod non legit pari pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate non inquirit.</hi> What the Church of <hi>England</hi> reads, that it doth piouſly believe; what it doth not read, with equal Piety omits to pry into.</p>

               </head>
               <p>TO all my Reaſons touching the abſurdity of the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and the repugnance of it with all humane reaſon, Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> gives an eaſie Anſwer, that in matters of Faith we muſt renounce Reaſon. He ſhould firſt prove that this is a point of Faith, a doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Word of God. His endeavors for it we have ſeen and declared to be vain in the precedent Chapter; then it being an Article of their making, he may not expect from us more ſubjection of our Intellects, then his re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſon will gain; and he confeſſing Reaſon do's not aſſiſt him, I take it for a confeſſion that he is caſt in the ſuit.</p>
               <p>I urged, that there was no neceſſity of forcing men to believe ſo hard a doctrine, neither for the effect of the Sacrament, nor for the verification of our Saviours words in the Inſtitution of it. Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> confeſſes the firſt, but denies the ſecond upon a very trivial, and no leſs weak Argument, which I will ſhew, rather proves againſt him then for him. He ſaies, that allowing the word <hi>Body</hi> is equivocal, and indifferent to be taken for a real or figurative Body; yet put in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, its determined to ſignifie that of which only the Predicate can be verified; but only of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53284:180"/>Chriſt's real Body, can it be verified that it was given for us: therefore this Propoſition, <hi>[This is my Body which is given for you]</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Chriſt's real Body. Here we have one Propoſition made of two, and the <hi>Predicate</hi> of the former made the <hi>Subject</hi> of the latter, to frame a deſigned fallacy. The former Propoſition, which is the proper Subject of our debate, is this, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> this is my Bod. The <hi>Subject</hi> of this Propoſition, is the Bread Chriſt had in his hands, and gave his Diſciples to eat. The <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> is our Saviours Body; and the queſtion is how to underſtand the words of the <hi>Predicate,</hi> ſo as they may be agreeable to the <hi>Subject.</hi> The words of the <hi>Predicate</hi> are indifferent to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a real or figurative Body, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined according to the quality of the <hi>Subject;</hi> that ſo the <hi>Identity</hi> of both, requiſite for a true Propoſition, may be ſeen, according to the rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned by Mr. <hi>I.S.</hi> all which proves that the word <hi>Body</hi> is to be taken rather in a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe then in a real; otherwiſe it could not be agreeable to the <hi>Subject,</hi> which was Bread real and viſible, and called ſuch before and after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, both by Chriſt and St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now take notice Reader, of the egregious fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of our Adverſary. The foreſaid complex Propoſition he aſſumes to work upon, <hi>[This is my Body which is given for you,]</hi> is compoſed of two Propoſitions, the one is hat now declared, relating to what Chriſt had in his hand, <hi>[This is my Body.]</hi> The other relating to Chriſt's Body of which, as ſubject of the ſecond Propoſition, another <hi>Predicate</hi> is affirmed, that it was given
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53284:181"/>for us upon the Croſs, <hi>[which was given for you.]</hi> Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> to do his own work, confounds theſe two Propoſitions, and makes the <hi>Predicate</hi> of the former Propoſition a <hi>Subject</hi> to the latter: and inſtead of fitting the ſaid <hi>Predicate</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Propoſition to the <hi>Subject</hi> of it (as he ſhould do, being to ſpeak to the purpoſe) he talks of fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to the <hi>Predicate</hi> of the ſecond Propoſition, about which is no queſtion; for none doubts whether it was the real Body of Chriſt that was given for us upon the Croſs. I allow you the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the ſame rule alledged for the ſecond Propoſition, <hi>[Chriſts Body was given for us,]</hi> that the indifferency of the word <hi>Body,</hi> which is the <hi>Subject,</hi> may be determined by the quality of the <hi>Predicate,</hi> and ſo taken for a real Body, becauſe 'twas a real Body w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was given for us upon the Croſs. Why will not you allow us the benefit of the ſame rule for the former Propoſition, <hi>[This is my Body,</hi>] which is the proper Subject of this Debate, that the indifferency of the word <hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>Predicate</hi> be determined by the quality of the <hi>Subject,</hi> which was the Bread Chriſt had in his hand, and of which, with more propriety and leſs violence may be affirmed, that its a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Body of Chriſt, then his living Body?</p>
               <p>But if the rules of your Logic muſt be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant as to demand, that when a diſcrepancy appears betwixt the <hi>Predicate</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of a Propoſition ſuppoſed to be true, its the <hi>Subject</hi> muſt be altered or faſhioned to a conformity with the <hi>Predicate,</hi> not the <hi>Predicate</hi> to conform with the <hi>Subject:</hi> what will you make of theſe two Propoſitions of our Saviour, <hi>I am the true
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53284:181"/>Vine,</hi> Joh. XV. 1. <hi>I am the bread of life,</hi> Joh. VI. 48. In which two Propoſitions a great diſcrepancy appears betwixt the <hi>Predicate</hi> and <hi>Subject.</hi> The perſon of Chriſt ſpeaking, is the Subject in both Propoſitions, Wine and Bread the <hi>Predicate.</hi> Will you have the perſon of Chriſt to be altered and converted to a Vine, and to Bread, to verifie thoſe Propoſitions; I hope you will not be ſo blaſphemous. And why? Becauſe Chriſt was ſeen to be a Man, not a Vine, or Bread: and ſo was the Bread in his hands ſeen and felt to be true Bread, no humane Body.</p>
               <p>I objected, that the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Can.</hi> 2. accurſing ſuch as affirm Bread and Wine to remain in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after Conſecration, doth oppoſe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> calling the conſecrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Bread. You ſay he called it Bread, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſuch then, but becauſe it was Bread before; as in Scripture we read, <hi>The blind do ſee, the lame do walk:</hi> not that they were blind and lame when they did ſee and walk, but becauſe they were ſuch before. I anſwer, that in theſe latter caſes an <hi>Ampliation</hi> of the term was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, becauſe the ſenſes did aſſure that thoſe men were not then blind or lame; but not ſo in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe; the ſenſes did ſee and feel what he called Bread, to be ſuch indeed.</p>
               <p>I produced ſeveral clear and expreſs teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the moſt ancient and renowned Fathers of the Church, delivering our doctrine, that the Elements in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> do not change their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but are <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Symbols</hi> of the Body of Chriſt abiding ſtill in their proper ſubſtance. To all which Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> anſwers, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:53284:182"/>is indeed a Type and Repreſentation of Chriſt's Body, but Chriſt himſelf is there both repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repreſented: as a King that would act a part in a Tragedy of his own Victories, he would be the thing repreſented, and the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation. Truly I wonder how this old <hi>Simile</hi> kept credit ſo long time among Romiſh Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſts, but more that it ſhould be brought to a ſerious diſpute. I wonder they ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a great indecency in the parity; if a Tragedy were made of the late Seige of <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,</hi> wherein the King of <hi>France</hi> was in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon active; would not a judicious man think it unbecoming the majeſty of ſo great a Prince, to go himſelf about all the Cities of the Country, acting a part in ſuch a Tragedy, to repreſent his own Chivalry? Why will not they think it inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that the King of Glory, Chriſt, ſhould act perſonally and corporally in all corners of the World, where the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is celebrated, being able to do all intended by it in a more intelligible way, and with more decency.</p>
               <p>But all this while our Adverſary ſlips the main Point intended by the teſtimony of the Fathers, that the Elements of Bread and Wine remain in their own nature unchanged after Conſecration; whereby they ſeem to lie under the curſe of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> now mentioned. To which teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies I will add another out of <hi>Dionyſius Syrus,</hi> writing upon the firſt Chapter of S. <hi>John.</hi> v. 14. <hi>and the word was made Fleſh.</hi> His words tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated by a moſt

               <p>To all theſe and the like Teſtimonies, Mr. <hi>I.S.</hi> ſaies, they are not ſo clearly for us, but that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi> and others of his ſide do find waies to give them another ſenſe, and therefore we need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an infallible living Judg to determine the ſenſe of the Fathers, as well as of Scripture; and that Judg being to be the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he may be ſure of a favorable ſentence, if the cauſe be devolved thither.</p>
               <p>But what if we find a Pope clearly delivering our Opinion twelve hundred years ago, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Sacramental Elements after Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>do not ceaſe to be the ſubſtance and nature of

Why <hi>Gelaſius, by the words ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, did mean the Accidents or Species of Bread and Wine, which do remain, and are to us the means of knowing the ſubſtance; and may not be called properly Accidents in this Caſe, becauſe there is no ſubſtance left for them to reſt upon, as the nature and common notion of an Accident do's require.</hi> And having deliver'd this moſt ſtrange and never heard of complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of contradictory expreſſions, to make of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents a ſubſtance, and with all, no ſubſtance of Bread to remain; he ſounds lowdly a triumph over his Adverſaries, that he has whipt them like boys with their own arms; and altho it be allowed <hi>gratis,</hi> that the foreſaid teſtimony ſhould be of Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> yet it ſerves nothing to their purpoſe. I could enlarge more upon the Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of <hi>Baronius</hi> his diſcourſe upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the injury he do's to <hi>Gelaſius</hi> in father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him ſo ridiculous a paradox: but I

               <p>And conclude Reader from this paſſage, what little hopes we may have of peace, and end of Controverſy among Chriſtians, by allowing the Pope to be infallible, when the moſt clear and plain words of a Pope are ſubject to an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of them ſo croſs, and diametrically oppoſite to the meaning of them according to common uſe.

               <p>MR. <hi>I.

                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53284:184"/>may be doubted; whereas moſt learned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Men, ſuch as <hi>Scotus</hi> chiefly was, did hold the contrary. Theſe are the expreſs words of <hi>Bellarmin, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Euchar. c.</hi> 23. Here you have <hi>Bellarmin</hi> declaring clearly againſt Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> that <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaid that Tranſubſtantiation was not an Article of Faith before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, and that both <hi>Scotus</hi> and other moſt learned and acute men were of opinion that the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is not clearly contained in Scripture.</p>
               <p>And truly, tho I had not ſeen <hi>Scotus</hi> his writing upon the point, I am apt to believe that Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhould be miſtaken rather then <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> but I have read over <hi>Scotus</hi> his diſcourſe upon this ſubject, not only in the printed Editions, but in the ancient MS. kept in <hi>Merton</hi> Coll. in <hi>Oxon.</hi> whereof he was a Fellow, with no ſmall admiration and compaſſion, to ſee ſo noble and excellent a wit forced to opine or ſeem to opine againſt his proper ſentiment, as he doth proteſt himſelf to do, to comply with Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> and the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council. Having ſtated the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Tranſubſtantiation, related the opinion of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and others for it, and confuted moſt vigorouſly their arguments out of Scripture and reaſon for it, as not convincing; at laſt yields to the opinion of <hi>Innocent</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Teneo igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur iſtam opinionem ibi poſitam ab Innocentio, quod ſubſtantia panis non maneat, ſed quod tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatur in Corpus Chriſti, non propter rationes praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctas, quia non cogunt.</hi> For which opinion to ſay ſomething, being forced to follow it, he alledges two conveniences. The firſt, that if the ſubſtance
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53284:185"/>of bread did remain under the Accidents of it, a man taking the Body and Blood of our Savior under ſuch Accidents would not be faſting; and ſo may not celebrate twice in one day: which is againſt that Canon <hi>de conſecrat. diſtinct. primâ in nocte.</hi> The ſecond conveniency is, that the Church prays, as appears in the Canon of the Maſs, the bread and wine may be made the Body and Blood of our Savior Jeſus Chriſt, but prays not for a thing impoſſible, therefore it is to be ſaid that the ſubſtance of bread ceaſes to be there, and is converted into the Body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Whoever knew the ſubtilty and exactneſs of <hi>Scotus</hi> his reaſoning, may eaſily perceive that he ſpoke againſt his own ſentiment when he alledged ſuch weak Arguments, as thoſe two now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and ſo, not to forfeit the credit of his ſubtilty, turns to proteſt with his accuſtomed ingenuity, that he followed this opinion only for the Authority of the Church, concluding thus: <hi>&amp; hoc principaliter teneo propter Authoritatem Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae, &amp;c.</hi> and the ſame his Scholiaſts declares of him upon the foreſaid words, ſaying, <hi>Tenet Doctor tertiam ſententiam, nempè panem converti in Corpus Chriſti, quia ſic Eccleſia tenet.</hi>

Lugdun. an. 1639.</note> Vid. <hi>Scot.</hi> in 4. diſt. 10. q. 3. <hi>Scotus</hi> holds the bread to be converted into the Body of Chriſt, becauſe the Church declared it ſo in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, not for any Authority of Scripture or reaſon which could move him to it. The ſame I may eaſily prove of other learned Schoolmen. By this you may ſee Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his raſhneſs in ſaying I did moſt falſely impoſe upon <hi>Scotus</hi> what both <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:53284:185"/>and himſelf declares to be his proper opinion.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame opinion with <hi>Scotus</hi> was <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> in 4. <hi>Sent. diſt.</hi> 11. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect. propter</hi> 3. where he declares, that the opinion affirming the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread to remain after Conſecration, was more convenient to obviate difficulties, rendring the Myſtery more hard to be believed, but that the contrary is to be held for the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Church. <hi>Cajetan</hi> ſaid, that only the ſaid declaration could make the words of our Saviour alledged for Tranſubſtantiation, appear convincing to that purpoſe. And <hi>Suarez</hi> tells us, his ſaying was commanded by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the V. to be expunged.</p>
               <p>An old Copy of <hi>Ocham</hi> I found in <hi>Dublin</hi> Library, was more fortunate in eſcaping their blurs. In his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                  <q>That to this opinion he conſems for the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Church, in favor of it, and not for any reaſon aſſiſting it.</q> The third opinion rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him is, that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remains after Conſecration; and of this he ſaies, <hi>Tertia opinio eſſet multum rationabilis, niſi
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53284:186"/>eſſet determinatio Eccleſiae in contrarium.</hi> 
                  <q>That this opinion were very rational, if the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Church were not contrary to it.</q> So that it is not any reaſon, nor any ground they ſaw for it in Scripture, made theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very Learned men conſent to the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, but only a blind Obedience to <hi>Innocents</hi> Decree in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> wiſhes we ſhould all have this ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Autority of the Church; and I wiſh with all my heart, that both we and he, and his party, and all Chriſtians, ſhould have due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Church truly Catholic, Primitive and Apoſtolic, declaring to us the Word of God by Canonical Scripture, and Univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in which Fountains of Truth neither Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation will be found, nor any of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which I pointed out for motives of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking their Communion.</p>
               <p>Neither is <hi>I. S.</hi> more fortunate in his attemt of putting a terror upon me, as if I had ſhock'd the Hierarchy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its raſhneſs to give divine Adoration to a Wafer, wherein they cannot be ſure Chriſt to be Preſent; this depending according to their own Principles, upon the Prieſts intention to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate, his due Ordination, and of the Biſhop that gave him Orders, his intention and due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and ſo upward of endleſs requiſites impoſſible to be certainly known. And what has all this to do with ſhocking the Hierarchy of the the Church of <hi>England?</hi> When I ſaw the man begin with ſo great a clap, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already a triumph, I expected the ſtory
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53284:186"/>of the Nags-head, or ſome other of their old Engines againſt the Legality of the Proteſtant Clergy ſhould come down: but all he brings is that we do alſo allow ſome things to be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially requiſite for the validity of a Sacrament, the defect of which nullifies the Sacrament. As for Baptiſm, water is requiſite, and the form of words, <hi>I baptize you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The Miniſter may vitiate this form, and utter ſomewhat in lieu of it, or omit ſome words of it, or add ſome other that would deſtroy the form. The ſame may happen in the Ordination of a Miniſter or Biſhop, and there is no certainty that no error of theſe ſhould have happen'd in any one of the whole train of our Ordainers, and if it was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any, all the Ordinations derived from him are null. Therefore we can have no Aſſurance of our Hierarchy.</p>
               <p>I leave the Judicious Reader to ſee what ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular exploit this man hath done herein againſt the Church of <hi>England?</hi> his reaſons alledged of doubting the Legality of its Miniſters, doth prove ſo much for rendring doubtful the Legality of the Roman Clergy, by his own confeſſion: but much more for what I am to add: firſt, that we do not make the effects of Sacraments to depend ſo much upon the intention and quality of the Miniſters, as Papiſts do. We entertain a better opinion of Gods goodneſs, that he will not have pious Souls loſe the fruit of their ſincere Endeavors; and will ſupply to that effect the defect of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: ſecondly, that their practice of mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words in a Language unknown to the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53284:187"/>People, and in a voice not audible, (eſpecially in the conſecration of the Euchariſt) is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errors and fraud then the way of our Church, where the Miniſter is to pronounce loudly and intelligibly the words of the form.</p>
               <p>But chiefly touching the ſubject of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcourſe (from which our Adverſary ſeems willing to divert) I mean the uſe and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, who run more hazard the Papiſts or we? In caſe a defect ſhould happen touching the conſecration we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the fruit of a ſpiritual Communion, and are not at the loſs that Papiſts are in the like caſe, who make the main fruit depend upon the real and corporal preſence of Chriſt in the hoſt. We run no danger of Idolatry, material or formal, giving the worſhip of Divinity to a thing that is not God; as Papiſts do, giving that kind of worſhip to any hoſt reputed to be duly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, which if it happens not to be ſo indeed, their act of worſhip is at leaſt a material Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in their own confeſſion: and to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a known danger of committing ſuch kind of Idolatry cannot chuſe but be criminal, as it is generally reputed to be a ſin for one to expoſe himſelf to a danger of committing a ſin. The parity of one honoring his Father, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly him to be his true Father, is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and undecent. A bad opinion he muſt have of his Mother, who doubts his reputed Father to be ſuch in truth. But what if he were in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial error, it is not a ſin, but a duty to pay reſpect unto him that adopts or owns him for a Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:53284:187"/>
I will conclude this matter with letting Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> ſee his raſhneſs, in pretending I was raſh in ſaying its intolerable boldneſs in ſome of his fellows to ſay, there is the ſame reaſon for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the hoſt, as for adoring Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. And he pretends I ſhould ſeem thereby not to underſtand their doctrine. Sir, I am not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with you in compariſon which of us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands better the Doctrine of both Churches: what I ſee evidently is, that either you do igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly miſunderſtand, or maliciouſly miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſtate of the Queſtion; that wanting an anſwer to my Arguments in their proper terms, you may faſhion them ſo, as your impertinent Diſcourſes may ſeem to ſtrike at ſomething, which is properly <hi>hoſtem tibi fingere quem ferias,</hi> to create your ſelf an Adverſary, ſuch as you may triumph over, that is, not to fit your anſwer to my Arguments, but my Arguments to that you will have us take for an anſwer; being what you have to ſay. This is very uſual with you, as in many occaſions I have declared from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Diſcourſe, and will further declare in others to the end of it, but in the preſent you appear notoriouſly guilty of this foul play.</p>
               <p>I do neither ignore or doubt, that if your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſts perſonal preſence in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated hoſt were true, there is as much reaſon to adore ſuch an hoſt, as to adore Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; both being the ſame thing in ſuch a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the Myſtery you pretend I ſhould not underſtand, but this is not the ſtate of the Queſtion with me. What I did, and do again, call intolerable boldneſs, is to ſay, that (the matter
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53284:188"/>ſtanding, as now it doth, doubtful and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted) there is as much reaſon for adoring the hoſt conſecrated, as there is for adoring Chriſt his perſon: ſince for adoring Chriſt we have ſeveral expreſs commands laid upon us in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which I related out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.23. but no intimation given of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſt in the Sacramental bread, ſuppoſing him corporally preſent there.</p>
               <p>But if you go to the object of both worſhips, Chriſt living in the World, and your hoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated: to ſay that there is as much ground for believing your doctrine of Divinity exiſtent in the latter as in the former, I ſaid, and ſay ſtill, its intolerable boldneſs, and a great injury to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, to make thoſe two things of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual certainty, whereof I was contented to make <hi>Bellarmin</hi>

               <p>HE will have the Precept of Communion run parallel with that of Baptiſm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I am well contented. Both are commanded by Chriſt: Baptiſm thus, <hi>If one be not born again by the Water and the Spirit, he ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Joh. VI. 53. And the Communion thus, <hi>If ye do not eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you ſhall not have life in you.</hi> The eſſential requiſites of Baptiſm are water and a ſet form of words. In this no alteration may conſiſt with the validity of the Sacrament: not ſo of the mode or circumſtances, whether it be with immerſion or ſprinkling. Herein alterations may be, and were admitted by the Church. Even ſo in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, the eſſence of it conſiſts in eating the Fleſh, and drinking the Blood of our Saviour. This may not be altered, but the mode or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, whether it be kneeling or ſtanding, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in leavened or unleavened Bread, whether white or red Wine; touching theſe Accidents there may be alterations without prejudice to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, but not touching the eſſential parts of Fleſh and Blood: in this much we agree on both ſides.</p>

Now what are we to underſtand by Fleſh, what by Blood our Saviour did not leave obſcure, ſo as we may err in ſo weighty a matter, wherein the life of our Souls doth conſiſt, but made it clear and viſible to us. He took Bread in his hands, and of it, he ſaid, <hi>this is my Body;</hi> he took likewiſe Wine in his hand, ſaying, <hi>this is my Blood.</hi> The way therefore to take his Body and Blood, is to take conſecrated Bread and Wine in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him. This is the way Chriſt did eſtabliſh the taking of this bleſſed Sacrament, this the Apoſtles and Primitive Church did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and this way all true Chriſtians ought to walk.</p>

S.</hi> cenſures it as a puſillanimity in me to be ſurprized at that famous <hi>non obſtante</hi> of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that notwithſtanding Chriſt did inſtitute this Sacrament in both kinds, and in the Primitive Church they adminiſtred it ſo, yet the Council thought convenient to ordain the contrary: I ſhould have a ſtrong ſtomach to ſwallow without chawing or examining what <hi>our Lord God the Pope</hi> orders, as the Gloſſiſt calls him. He is Vice-god upon earth, as all of them ſtile him, and of ſuch priviledg that the commands of God muſt oblige no further then he pleaſes. If he tells us that virtue is vice, and vice virtue, we are to believe him. Yet Mr. <hi>I.S.</hi> will reaſon the caſe with us. He might have ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that labor, for I declared it was ſufficient to my purpoſe to know they will pretend reaſon for inverting Chriſts Inſtitutions. But how well beſeeming the gravity of a Council, are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he alledges, grounded upon principles of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53284:189"/>nigardlineſs &amp; nicety. To ſpare expences of wine, and hinder the inconveniency of clean people to drink out of the ſame Cup with the unclean. Is there not ſo much plenty of Wine now in the World, as was in the Primitive Church, and the Communion leſs frequent? Were not clean peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then in the World? Shall a groundleſs fear of annoying the body over-weigh a certain dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loſing the Soul. Chriſt having declared, that if <hi>we do not eat his Fleſh and drink his Blood, we ſhall not have life in us.</hi> Is it fair that ſuch fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous reaſons as theſe ſhould ſuffice for a Pope to alter the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and no reaſon, be it ever ſo evident, ſhould excuſe oppoſing a Popes Decree?</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> tells us, that in theſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> VI. <hi>If ye do not eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you ſhall not have life in you.</hi> The Particle <hi>[and]</hi> muſt be taken disjunctively for <hi>[or,]</hi> not cop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>latively. So as the command muſt be underſtood of eating his Fleſh, or drinking his Blood; becauſe in the Hebrew Language, wherein our Saviour ſpake, the Particle <hi>and</hi> is capable of ſuch a ſenſe. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> ſaid ſo. I ſee they did, and thereby I ſee that a bad cauſe will make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons run to narrow ſhifts. At this rate you may pretend to comply with the precept of loving God and your Neighbor, by loving either, tho you do not love both. And ſo of the precept of honoring your Father and Mother, that you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by honoring one, tho you deny that duty to the other: becauſe the Particle <hi>and</hi> in thoſe Precepts, is capable of a disjunctive ſenſe, and may be conſtrued <hi>or.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:53284:190"/>
Moreover, this Argument would prove more then the Council, or <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or <hi>Suarez</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would have. That there is no command of drinking the Blood of our Saviour. So the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and Romiſh Writers, commonly do pretend, that Chriſts living Body being corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the conſecrated Bread, and a living Body containing Fleſh and Blood, by taking the Bread we take both Fleſh &amp; Blood. But the ſuppoſition of this Argument, that Chriſt is corporally preſent in the Sacrament, being pretended, &amp; even proved clearly in our Opinion to be falſe, its in vain to perſwade us with an Argument upon that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. Beſides, tho that Suppoſition were true, its not eaſie to underſtand how, by ſwallowing an Animal conſiſting of fleſh and blood, without ſeparating both, one may be ſaid properly to drink blood. All theſe Abſurdities may be excuſed by following literally the words and and practice of our Saviour, adminiſtring the Sacrament as he did in both kinds.</p>
               <p>Here I am to admire again the good heart and confidence of Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> in telling us that we have a poſitive example of Chriſt himſelf, that once gave the Communion in the Accidents of Bread alone to his Diſciples, in the way towards <hi>Emaus, pag.</hi> 217. How come you to be ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in affirming that of Chriſt with his Diſciples in <hi>Emaus,</hi> ſhould have bin a Communion rather then a common Supper <hi>Suarez</hi> in 3. <hi>p. Diſ.</hi> 71. <hi>Sec.</hi> 1. ſaies, the Opinion of many Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors denying it to have bin a Communion, ſeems to him more probable. And <hi>Maldonate</hi> ſuppoſes many good writers to be of the ſame Opinion.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53284:190"/>But beſides, tho it were a Communion, what is your ground for ſaying he ſhould not have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Cup in it? That only Bread is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the Diſciples told he was <hi>known of them in breaking of Bread.</hi> But it is very frequent in Scripture to expreſs a Dinner or Supper, where both meat and drink is taken, by this term of eating Bread, and the Diſciples might have found ſufficient ſigns of knowing Chriſt by his way of breaking the Bread, without mentioning more of his actions.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Suarez</hi> in 3. <hi>p. Diſ.</hi> 42. <hi>Sec.</hi> 1. declares it to be the Opinion of all Divines, and his own, that the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine are the <hi>Eſſential Conſtitutes</hi> of this Sacrament, <hi>Dico</hi> 30 <hi>Species conſecratas eſſe Euchariſtiae Sacramentum, ſeu ad ejus conſtitutionem intrinſece &amp; eſſentialiter pertinere.</hi> That the conſecrated <hi>Species</hi> do belong eſſentially to the Conſtitution of this Sacrament. How then could he give the Sacrament without the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine, if they be <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Conſtitutes</hi> of it. But <hi>Suarez,</hi> ſay you in his <hi>Diſp.</hi> 71. ſaies, that the whole Eſſence of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament conſiſts in either kind; and therein (ſay I) contradicts his former doctrine, as alſo that of <hi>Gelaſius</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>I.

That the Communion under both kinds is not needful, either for the effects of the Sacrament, or for verifying the words of Chriſt in the Inſtitution of it. But the Difference is wide, firſt as to the effects, Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> himſelf confeſſes, pag. 201. that Chriſt might, were he pleaſed, have given us the effects of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with a figurative preſence only. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to the tenour of our Saviours words in the Inſtitution of it, many of their own more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exact Scholemen do affirm, that the ſaid words do not convince for Tranſubſtantiation, in force of their proper ſenſe, as we have ſeen in the precedent Chapter. And

               </head>
               <p>Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> is very tedious, and no leſs imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, in telling us its not a ſin to make Images abſolutely, becauſe God made man to his own Image, and Proteſtants do make Images of the King and Queen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he might ſpare this labour, I having declared that it is not only lawful, but commendable to make Images, and good uſe of them to ſeveral purpoſes. The ſin is to adore and worſhip them, that being directly oppoſite to Gods Commandment ſet down in the twentieth Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thee any graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou ſhalt not bow down thy ſelf to them;</hi> of which ſin the Roman Church is guilty, by ordering ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and reverence to be given to Images. In what degree, <hi>Azorius</hi> with ſeveral others of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, do tells us, ſaying, the ſame honor is to be given to them which is due to the Prototype, and conſequently the honor of <hi>Latria</hi> to the Image of God and Chriſt, the honor of <hi>Dulia</hi> to the Images of other Saints. So <hi>Azorius</hi> ſaies, (and not I, as Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> falſifies) in theſe words, <hi>Conſtans eſt Theologorum ſententia Imaginem codem honore &amp; cultu honorari &amp; coli, quo colitur id cujus eſt Imago.</hi> 
                  <q>It is the conſtant opinion of Divines,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53284:192"/>that the Image is to be honored and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the ſame manner as the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is an Image.</q> Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaies reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Azorius</hi> has no ſuch words: but if he did read attentively, the place I quoted of <hi>Azorius, Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Inſt.

                  <q>That it is a Catholic verity, that worſhip is to be given to Images, that is to ſay, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Service and Submiſſion, by embraces, light burning, offering of Incenſe, uncovering the head.</q> 
                  <hi>Azorius</hi> quotes for the ſame opinion, <hi>Aquinas, Bonaventure, Alenſis, Cajetan,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other ancient and modern Schole-men. Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> will not have us believe all theſe Doctors in this their Declaration, touching the Romiſh worſhip of Images. But who are you good Mr. <hi>I. S. Quidam neſcio quis, nec puto nomen habet,</hi> one I know not who, and as I ſee nameleſs, that we muſt believe you, rather then ſo many famous Doctors now mentioned.</p>
               <p>Give to your worſhip of Images what name you pleaſe, to worſhip them at all, is a formal tranſgreſſion of the divine Precept above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53284:193"/>and therefore a grievous fin. You would fain prove out of Scripture that God ordered Images to be adored, which is to pretend that God ſhould contradict himſelf, and ſo it appears in the ill ſucceſs of your attempt upon finding your doctrine in Scripture. Your firſt diſcovery in Scripture is, that God commanded the Brazen Serpent to be put up to be adored, ſay you. Gods command touching that matter is ſet down, <hi>Numb.</hi> XXIV. 8. in theſe words, <hi>Make thee a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Serpent, and ſet it upon a Pole, and it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it ſhall live.</hi> Here is no mention of adoring that Serpent: you ſay that looking upon it, was to be with inward reverence and veneration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in adoration or worſhip doth properly conſiſt. Then when we look upon a Church with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as being the houſe of God, we adore it, the ſame when we look upon the Bible, when a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful child looks reverently upon his Father, all is adored.</p>
               <p>Likely the Iſraelites in time came to be of your opinion, and to adore the Serpent: but how well was that taken at their hands, you may ſee in the ſecond of <hi>Kings</hi> XVIII. 4. That the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King <hi>Ezechias, brake in pieces the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that Moſes had made, for unto thoſe daies the Children of Iſrael did burn Ineenſe to it.</hi> While they only looked upon it, according to Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, it was beneficial to them, but when their devotion grew to a worſhip, it provoked Gods Indignation declared in that action of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> which the ſacred Writer approves in theſe words, <hi>And he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord.</hi>

Your ſecond diſcovery is, <hi>Joſue</hi> VII. 6. where only we find that <hi>Joſue,</hi> together with the Elders of Iſrael, fell upon their faces before the Ark, and praied to God; and that you take for an adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ark. So whenſoever you pray before an Altar or a Bible, you adore the Altar and the Bible. The third Inſtance, to which you ſay Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants will never anſwer, is, that the Lords Supper is a repreſentation of Chriſts Paſſion, and a figure of his Body, and is religiouſly worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, if they do what St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 28. And what do's St. <hi>Paul</hi> require in that place? This, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi> That Proteſtants ſhould never anſwer this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no wonder, what anſwer can be where no queſtion is: and queſtionleſs there is no ſign, or the leaſt inſinuation of Adoration to be paid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Communion Bread in the place you quote. It is a work of your fancy, no diſcovery of common ſenſe, to imagine worſhip given by Gods Ordinance to the Serpent, to the Ark, or to the Communion Bread, in the places you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. You are to give me leave to tell you, that your Argument is ſo frivolous, as requires no more ſerious anſwer, then to put you in mind of a Spaniſh Proverb, <hi>Quien Vaccas ha perdido cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerrosſe le antexan,</hi> who has loſt his Oxen, Bells do ring in his cars. His vehement deſire of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Oxen, makes him think every noiſe of a bough, or leaf of a tree ſtirred be the wind, to be the ſound of the Bells his Oxen bare: ſo your ſtrong fancy for Image-worſhip, makes you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, even where no ſhape nor ſound of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>

You confeſs Images were little uſed in the Primitive Church, nay, were abſolutely prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Council of <hi>Eliberis;</hi> but that was, ſay you, to avoid the ſcandal of Pagans, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe of thoſe converted from Paganiſm. And are there not Pagans yet in the world? Is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of them ſtill procured?

               <p>You will not be engaged in defending the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of their doctrine herein, with ſaying, that the ſame Precept of not adoring God by an Image, ſhould not oblige Chriſtians; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is it eaſie to find the coherence of it.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53284:195"/>which was ſo offenſive to God, I mean, that they did adore it as an Image of God, and not believing it was a real God, is moſt apparent by the words of the Context, <hi>Theſe be thy Gods, Oh Iſrael, which brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> Exod. XXXII. 4. Who can believe that men not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtitute of common ſenſe, would ſeriouſly judg that Images made before themſelves of their own gold, ſhould be a real God? In what ſenſe or reaſon could they ſay it was he that brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was don long before that Calf was made? If you ſay that <hi>Aaron</hi> declared that Calf to be a God, ſaying, <hi>Theſe are thy Gods,</hi> or, <hi>this is thy God,</hi> as you have in the ninth of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the plural being taken for the ſingular in the former place by a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſm:</hi> I anſwer, it was a tropical Expreſſion, as you are wont to ſay, where Images are of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>This is St. Peter, and this is St. Paul,</hi> meaning the Images of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And as you ſay, in your Proceſſions of holy Friday, of the Croſs you bear in your hand, and raiſe up to be adored by the people, bowing upon their knees, <hi>Ecce lignum crucis in quo ſalus mundi pepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> Behold the timber of the Croſs upon which was fixed the Saviour of the world.

In the like ſenſe you are to conceive <hi>Aaron</hi> did ſpeak of the golden Calf, (if you will not make him quite ſenſeleſs) when he ſaid, <hi>This is thy God, oh Iſrael, which brought thee out of the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53284:196"/>Land of Egypt,</hi> which is to ſay, This is a Type or Image of thy God who brought thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and under that notion the people did adore it. And all this while I hope you will not pretend to abſolve them from the guilt of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, for which they were ſo ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God; as we read in the 32. ch. of <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dus.</hi> Therefore Idolatry is not only to adore an Image as God, but alſo to adore God in an Image.</p>
               <p>If we will give credit to Pagans, touching their belief, they will tell us, they were never ſo blind as to think the Statues they adored were Gods, <hi>Nemo unquam tam fatuus fuit,</hi> ſaies <hi>Cicero, qui ſaxum &amp; lapidem</hi> Jovem <hi>eſſe credidit.</hi> None ever was ſo void of ſenſe as to ſay that a ſtone ſhould be <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Neither could ſuch a belief conſiſt with what is generally ſuppoſed by them, that their Gods are in heaven. So the Inhabitants of <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> when they ſaw <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> heal one that was a Creeple from his birth, ſaid, <hi>The Gods are come down to us in the likeneſs of men,</hi> Act. XIV. 11. And if even Pagans thought it a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity unbecoming men of common ſenſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſtock or ſtone to be a God, leſs ought we to imagine, that the Iſraelites with ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of inſtruction ſhould be ſo brutiſh. Their guilt therefore was not to believe the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calf was a God, but to attempt the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God by an Image, which is your guilt.</p>
               <p>You conclude that to worſhip the Image of Chriſt and his Saints, cannot be called Idolatry. For an Idol (ſay you) is a repreſentation of a Deity that has no being, but Chriſt and his Saints <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave a being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you ſpeak of the ſubject of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53284:196"/>Idolatrous worſhip tending to ſomething created, it is true that it looks upon a Deity that hath no being. But if you believe S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the real object of their worſhip was the true God which he preached, <hi>Whom you ignorantly worſhip, him declare I unto you.</hi> Acts 17.23. and notwithſtanding he rebuked them for Idolaters; therefore Idolatry is not only a worſhip dedicated to falſe Gods, but alſo a worſhip of the true God by a way prohibited.</p>
               <p>But how will this your diſcourſe reach to ſave from Idolatry the worſhip given to Images of Saints, that have in them no Divinity real or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended? Is it becauſe they have a being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to a Chimera or nothing? then the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> in their Statues, (and ſo of other Idols) were no Idolaters. Thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or Idols were repreſentations of men (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther living or dead, is not material) not Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, but ſuch as had a real being. Read the origin of Idolatry deſcribed in the 14. Chapter of Wiſdom from the 12. verſe: you ſhall find it begun by making Images of men abſent or dead to honor their memory. Beſides your ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is clear contrary to what Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the worſhip of Images ſuppoſes, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But as you hope to be ſaved, will you lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide prejudices and ſubtilties a while, and ſpeak
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53284:197"/>once ſincerely: what it it that makes you ſo eager for the worſhip of Images? is it any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precept that moves or forces to it? we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard you talk of any ſuch precept, and there is at leaſt a very probable aſſurance of a precept of God extant, prohibiting under terrible pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty ſuch a worſhip. There is moreover a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain danger of occaſioning, in the ruder ſort, a downright groſs Idolatry, by an abſolute direct worſhip of the Images you ſet up to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, without thoſe diſtinctions and preciſions wherewith you pretend to juſtify your practice. Of which <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> gives this teſtimony;

               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:53284:197"/>
               <p>This being ſo, what prudence can it be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your own Salvation and the Salvation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto a certain danger, by practicing a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at leaſt very probably prohibited by God under pain of damnation? This is the unhappy condition you are in, and our great advantage of you in our debates, that if you are in an error, as very probably you ſeem to be, you are liable to damnation: not ſo we, tho you ſhould be in the right; for on our part there is no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of any divine precept, &amp; conſequently no fear of damnation in not worſhipping an Image. In the ſame caſe you are in your worſhip of the Euchariſt. If Chriſt be not there after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you pretend, you are damnable Idolaters, as many of your own Authors do, and any that is rational muſt needs, confeſs. But on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſide the truth be in that controverſy, our practice is free from danger of ſinning by not paying the worſhip of <hi>Latria</hi> to the Euchariſt, whereas no precept of God forces us to give it ſuch worſhip. This with the like advantages, which we have of you in all other points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, made me chuſe the way of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as ſurer to ſalvation then yours.</p>
               <p>What profit do you expect by the worſhip of Images? I underſtand what profit may be in the uſe of devout Images (if ſeparated from the worſhip) that they may be a Book to the ruder ſort, for raiſing their minds unto heavenly things. But this benefit is not ſo great, nor the hope of getting Heaven this way ſo warrantable: as the danger of loſing it by unlawful worſhip, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent. While the uſe of Images was harmleſs
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53284:198"/>and beneficial, it was juſtly retained. It were inſolence in a member of any Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to oppoſe a cuſtom or uſe introduced in it, while indifferent and not oppoſite to a higher Law. But if that uſe did run to an abuſe and tranſgreſſion of Gods Commandments, then it is to be reformed or rejected. This is what happen'd in the caſe of the brazen Serpent, as before related. And this is the caſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches with Images. While and where pious and innocent uſe was made of them, they permitted them, and ſo they do yet. But when they ſaw the abuſe of unlawful worſhip given to them, they removed them from the eies of the Vulgar, apt to commit thoſe abuſes in places of worſhip.</p>
               <p>Now we have ſeen how far this kind of abuſe hath grown with your people both Learned and Vulgar. As for the latter, reflect upon what we have related out of <hi>Vives</hi> and <hi>Polydor.</hi> Add to it the teſtimony of <hi>George Caſſander,</hi> a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for his calm and even temper as well as for his learning, and who by both might have contributed to the peace and unity of Chriſtian Churches, if the unflexible pride of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſuffer any limit to be put to its Ambition.

Whence follows what the forementioned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſaid, That the worſhip of Images being to be meaſured by the Quality of their <hi>Prototypes,</hi> the worship of <hi>Latria</hi> is due to the Image of Chriſt; that being the worship which is due to himſelf. And by your denial of this to be the doctrine of your Church Mr. <hi>I.

               <p>Mr. I.S. is ſo exact a Diſputant, that he takes it for a ſufficient anſwer to my Arguments, if he do's but mention the ſubject of them, and ſay ſomthing of what his notes or ſtock of knowledg do's afford him, without taking the trouble of examining, whether what he ſaies be to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my Arguments or no. This is uſual with him, but very conſpicuous in the preſent caſe of their Invocation of Saints. I begun accuſing their exceſſes in calling the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> their <hi>life and hope,</hi> their Redeemereſs and Savioureſs. This I ſaid to be contrary to St. <hi>Peters</hi> declaration, That <hi>there is no ſalvation in any other beſides Jeſus Chriſt, and that there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Act. IV. 12. To this Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaies, it proves we muſt not ask the Saints on earth to pray for us, which is to prove too much. I hope Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> himſelf will not be ſo deſperate as to call his Colleague, whoſe praiers he deſires, his Life and Hope, his Saviour and Redeemer. But how comes it to prove we muſt not deſire at all the praiers of Saints upon earth?</p>
               <p>Two exceſſes of Papiſts in their Invocation of Saints I took in hand to reprehend. To ſpeak of all, the brevity which my buſineſs then did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53284:201"/>me to, would not permit. The one is to call the Virgin <hi>Mary Savioureſs, &amp;c.</hi> the other, to dedicate more Churches, and addreſs more prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Saints then to Chriſt. Both which exceſſes I convinc'd of error by thoſe paſſages of Scripture, which declare Chriſt our Lord to be our only Saviour, and that he is more willing and able to help us then any other Saint, and that he invites us to come to himſelf for remedy of all our needs. Your way to anſwer this, were either to purge your Church of thoſe exceſſes, or to prove that the Scriptures which I alledged did not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thoſe practices of yours to be exceſſes. You do neither, but in lieu thereof, you ſpeak only of deſiring the praiers of Saints who live yet upon earth: whereby you alter the ſtate and terms of the queſtion. I ſpoke of praying to Saints who are no more on earth, and fitted my Texts to the Confutation of that practice. You ſpeak of deſiring thoſe who are not yet departed this life, to pray for us: which are far different things. And ſo we find the latter practiced in the Goſpel, but not the former. But you muſt ſay ſomthing, and tho not to the purpoſe, it muſt be called an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>I related ſome deſperate expreſſions of your Preachers over-valuing Saints. And you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing they were mad, in ſo much, fall into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations againſt me for leaving the Roman Church, becauſe I ſaw ſome mad men in it. And thence you fall to your wonted immodeſt raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, without regarding how far you go from truth and the purpoſe. Where did you find me ſay, that for the madneſs of thoſe Friers only, I
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53284:201"/>forſook the Roman Church? Did not I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg many other very grave cauſes of my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution therein? Did I ſay this was a cauſe at all for me to leave that Church? I only reflected upon it as on very bad Fruit that declares the corruption of the Tree. And in caſe it ſhould be in ſome meaſure a cauſe, how come you to imagine or think to perſwade others it ſhould be the only cauſe? A thief that was hanged for ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a purſe, wherein were twenty pounds and ſix pence, becauſe you heard in the proceſs of his cauſe mention made of ſix pence, were it inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous or juſt to exclaim at the Judges, as if they did condemn a man to be hanged for ſtealing ſix pence?</p>
               <p>I confeſs, your diſingenuity herein is hateful to me; but if you think it ſhould not be ſo, pray then anſwer me to theſe two Queſtions: If a Villain did come by night and cut down a ſcore or two of thoſe fair Trees that grace the Walks of the Roial Park of St. <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> would you think it too much ſeverity that ſuch a Villain ſhould be whipt about the ſtreets for ſo great an Inſolence? But if after this check he ſhould run about the City and Country with a little branch of one of thoſe Trees in his hand, exclaiming againſt the cruelty of the Judges, as if they had order'd him to be whipt about the ſtreets of <hi>London</hi> for cutting that little branch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; would not you think him worthy to be whipt again for his notorious calumny? Behold your caſe: I expreſs'd many grievous faults of the Roman Church which occaſioned my with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from her, Idolatry, Superſtition, cruelty
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53284:202"/>in the conduct of Souls, impiety in preferring her own laws to thoſe of God: raſhneſs, and even madneſs in her worſhip and Invocation of Saints: and among others, related the frantic expreſſions of a Friar in extolling his Saint, as one of the Branches proceeding from that vitiated Tree. Of this Branch you lay hold, and cry that I have left the Communion of the Roman Church only, becauſe I ſaw in it a mad Friar. Give me leave to tell you, that this kind of arguing deſerves no better than whipping in the Scholes.</p>
               <p>And having anſwered my Arguments upon this Subject, ſay you, and having given no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them, ſay I, as now I have ſhewn: you provoke me to a trial of your Scholaſtic skill, touching the knowledg that Saints in heaven have of our affairs here, and how far they are concerned for them; a thing whereof even your ableſt Schole-men could never yet give a clear account. Whoever ſhall pleaſe to read their Writings on this Subject, will ſee a Theater of confuſion. The moſt that ever could be cleared of what they alledg, and you can pick out of them, is that God can, and ſomtimes did reveal unto Saints in heaven ſome earthly concerns: but that all the Saints in heaven ſhould know all our thoughts, and all our particular concerns, could never be ſaid upon any probable ground, much leſs with certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And yet a certain knowledg of it were requiſite to ſave your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice from the note of blindneſs and ſolly, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch frequent recourſe to them by mental and vocal praiers for all your particular concerns. I ſay moreover, that tho you were certain they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53284:202"/>did ſee all our peculiar concerns, and were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be concerned for us; yet you fall very ſhort of giving a formal anſwer to my exception, taken againſt your more frequent recourſe to them, then to Chriſt for Interceſſion, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating more Temples to their names, then to the name of God and Chriſt. How can this conſiſt with our Chriſtian acknowledgment of Chriſt to be our only Mediator and Advocate? And if you deny ſo much to him, I hope you will not doubt he is at leaſt our chief Mediator and Advocate: &amp; being ſo, how come you to have leſs recourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him then to inferior Saints? which was that I charg'd upon your practice. To which you gave no anſwer, becauſe you ſaw no rational or Chriſtian anſwer could be given: and ſo finding it an eaſier work to fall upon your accuſtomed ſcurrilous Sarcaſms, you returned them for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>Only to that of building more Churches, and offering praiers and devotions to your ſuppoſed Saints, then unto Chriſt, becauſe you would ſeem to ſay ſomthing, tho nothing indeed to the purpoſe, You ſay at laſt, that the honor you give to the Saints, you give it to God in them, or to them for God. But who can underſtand this to be a good way to pleaſe God? If an earthly King would have the Prince his Son and Heir, to be Solicitor General to him in favor of his Subjects, and that all Roial graces and favors ſhould paſs unto them by the hands of his Son; Can any man rationally imagine it would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſuch a King, that his Subjects neglecting their Applications to the Prince, ſhould make
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53284:203"/>all, or the moſt frequent to inferior Servants of the Court? Apply this example, and if you do not ſee by it the unreaſonableneſs of that practice of yours, I think we may conclude that paſſion and prejudice has blinded you ſo far as not to ſee the light of noon-day.</p>
               <p>Add to all this that many of your ſuppoſed Saints poſſibly may not be Saints indeed, but wretched Souls damned in Hell. Whereof your own Hiſtories do afford no few inſtances, and the poſſibility of the Caſe is evident: for moſt of your Saints were Canonized or called Saints by Vulgar opinion; not by that more exact ſcrutiny, which in latter Ages was ordained to prevent the Invocation of Impoſtors and Cheats for Saints through Vulgar error. It is manifeſt that ſuch wicked men are ſolicitous, and not ſeldom ſucceſsful in getting the credit of Saints with the Vulgar. That's the buſineſs of hypocrites; when true Saints make it theirs to hide their virtues, and pleaſe only the eies of God.</p>
               <p>And even now, after ſo many ſolemnities and ſcrutinies ordained to proceed to a Canonization, the matter ſtill remains uncertain. Many of your learned Schole-men deny the Pope to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible therein. He may be mis-informed, and why not? May not Cheats intervene, and Bribes work in ſuch Informations as in others? A Town or Society that will be engaged to get one of their Members Canonized for Saint, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obtain conſiderable Emoluments of credit and intereſt to their body, may poſſibly uſe thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means which other ſolicitations of men tending to the like purchaſe are capable of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:53284:203"/>
All this being ſo, how can you defend at leaſt from blindneſs and imprudence, your practice of more frequent recourſe to your ſuppoſed Saints, then to the ſupreme undoubted Saint of Saints Jeſus Chriſt? Not to treat at preſent how much this doctrine of the Invocation of Saints is in it ſelf injurious to God, by giving that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Creatures which belongs only to himſelf; as may appear by all thoſe places of Scripture which appropriate our Invocation to God only, in regard of his incommunicable Attributes of Omniſcience, infinite goodneſs, and power: nor how diſhonorable it is to Chriſt, both in regard of his infinite merit, and office of Mediator.</p>
               <p>And finally, the ſilence of ſuch a practice in the firſt and better Ages of the Church, ſo as Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> confeſſes, that in the Authors who lived nearer the Apoſtles times, in the three firſt Centuries no foot-ſteps can be found of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints: this ſilence, I ſay, is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument of the unlawfulneſs of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, &amp; how unſuitable it is to the ſpirit of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. <hi>Origen</hi> is not only ſilent of ſuch a practice, but directly proteſts againſt it in ſeveral places, aſſirming that Praiers and Supplications are to be directed only to God by Jeſus Chriſt. For being inquired by <hi>Celſus,</hi> what opinion Chriſtians had of Angels; he anſwers, That tho the Scripture ſomtime calls them Gods, it is not with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we ought to worſhip them, <hi>For all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53284:204"/>unreaſonableneſs of making addreſſes to Angels, by reaſon of the little knowledg we have of their condition; he adds, That even ſuch a knowledg, if we were furniſhed with it,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Origen contra Celſum lib. 5. p. 233. Edit. Cantab.</note> 
                  <hi>would not permit us to preſume to pray unto any other but God the Lord of of all, who is abundantly ſufficient for all by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the Son of God.</hi> And after he declares how Angels and Saints may aſſiſt us, and pray for us to God if we be in the favor of God, and do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to pleaſe him, <hi>We muſt endeavor to pleaſe God only,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>who is over all, and pray that he may be propitious to us, procuring his good will with piety and all kind of virtue.</hi> And reflecting upon <hi>Celſus</hi> his propoſal of worſhipping Demons or Angels, he addeth theſe remarkable words,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 8. pag. 120.</note> 
                  <hi>But if he will yet have us to procure the good will of any other after him, that is God over all, let him conſider that as when the body is moved, the motion of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow doth follow it; ſo in like manner, having God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to us, who is over all, it followeth that we ſhall have all his friends, both Angels, and Souls, and Spirits favorable to us; for they have a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with them that are thought worthy to find favor with God ....... ſo as we may be bold to ſay, that when men, who with a reſolution propoſe to themſelves the beſt things, do pray unto God, many thouſands of the ſacred powers pray together with them uncalled upon.</hi> Here and in other ſuch Teſtimonies of <hi>Origen,</hi> and others of his time, we find mention of Angels and Saints, to pray for men, and to help them by Gods appointment, but we find no mention at all of ſuch a thing as an Invocation of them.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53284:204"/>He ſaies they pray together with us, when we pray to God himſelf, and that not becauſe we prai'd firſt to them to pray with us, but <hi>uncalled upon.</hi> Here we have the Spirit of that Church truly Catholic and Apoſtolic declared to us, that we are to make our Addreſſes of Praiers and Invocations to God alone, and thereby win the aſſiſtance and praiers of heavenly Spirits in our favor.

               <head>CHAP. XXV. <hi>A great ſtock of Faults and Abſurdities diſcovered in Mr.</hi> I. S. <hi>his defence of Purgatory.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SIR, as you ſhew your ſpecial ſtudy to be to ſoure your Pen with all manner of ſawci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even without occaſion given to you, and ſtarting often from the point and purpoſe for to pleaſure your ſelf in the Sea of bitterneſs: ſo it is my no ſmall care (and certainly a harder task then to anſwer your Arguments) to refrain my Pen from pouring upon you continual ſhowers of heavy Cenſures, whether reflecting upon your boldneſs, in aſſerting manifeſt untruths; or upon your rudeneſs or malice, in miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding or miſ-repreſenting the ſtate and terms of the Queſtion in every point of my Diſcourſe you pretend to anſwer; or ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhamefully or childiſhly the point and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and propoſing another of your own inſtead of anſwering, as Schole-boies do with riddles or hard queſtions, as they call them, when they want an anſwer to one of them, they return for anſwer another of that kind of Queſtions. Of all theſe faults I could eaſily convince you guilty in every point you handled from the beginning of your Book to the end: I have abſtained from doing it in formal reflexions (tho in my replies faced with your Propoſals, the diſcreet
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53284:205"/>Reader may eaſily ſee your foreſaid faults really contained) out of my averſion to offenſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and becauſe I fear to offend my friends and Patrons on this ſide, as you hope to pleaſe yours by bitter Language. But when you tell palpable untruths, ſhall I deſert the defence of truth not to make you a liar? when you clearly abandon the queſtion propoſed, and miſrepreſent the caſe, or miſunderſtand it, ſhall I deſiſt in my ſerious and cloſe enquiry of the truth, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover your ignorance and weakneſs? So much complacency you are not to expect from me; and by ſhewing you are guilty of all theſe faults in your reply to my diſcourſe upon the point of Purgatory, you will perceive I have bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to you, in not enlarging upon a formal diſcovery of them in all the points hitherto treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon among us. Now to the proof of ſo much.</p>
               <p>I begun my Diſcourſe upon the point of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, with the method and order that exact Diſputants are wont to obſerve in handling ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly any ſubject; Firſt examining what we are to underſtand under the notion of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Seeondly whether ſuch a thing be really extant. As to the firſt, I told how I did not find the more learned Men of the Roman Church ſo confident as the Vulgar, in taking for Purgatory a determinate place in the bowels of the Earth, with thoſe frightful qualities their Legends do ſpecify; being contented to conclude from ſome places of Scripture by conjecture, that after this life there muſt be ſome place to expiate ſins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out determining whether that place be over, or
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53284:206"/>under, or in the Earth, or whether the pain be heat, or cold, or darkneſs, or tempeſt, &amp;c. This you call raillery; but it is not my humor to rally in ſo ſerious matters: they are the terms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the more grave and modeſt Writers of your own party do expreſs the matter. And ſuch is the unhappineſs of your engagement, that hardly your doctrine can be mentioned in terms that may not make it ridiculous. All this you ſay is to no purpoſe, for the queſtion is not where Purgatory is, or what is the condition of People there, but whether there be any ſuch thing as Purgatory? I would fain know what purpoſe is that you ſay this Diſcourſe is not pertinent to? I am confident it is the purpoſe of fitting my que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to your anſwers, when you want anſwers fitting my queſtions. You ſaw your ſhame diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in deluding the vulgar with Romantic No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for which your learned Men could not diſcover any ſerious or ſolid ground; and not finding your ſelf with ſtock to anſwer that charge, you muſt put it off, and ſay, it is not to the purpoſe. You are much a ſtranger to Diſputes and Books, if you do not know that there are queſtions touching the eſſence, quality and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Purgatory, as well as touching the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of it. You never knew what is good Logic, and in it an orderly procedure to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, if you did not learn that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Quid ſit,</hi> ought to precede in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Queſtion, <hi>An ſit.</hi> That to know whether a thing be exiſtent, we muſt have a knowledg of the quality of ſuch a thing, at leaſt as far as the underſtanding of the word, and ſome
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53284:206"/>knowledg of the thing ſignified by it. If you ſend one to the Market to know whether a Camel be there, you muſt prepare him with ſome notion of the thing, whereby he may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from a Cow, or a Goat; otherwiſe how can he bring you a report of the exiſtence of a Camel in that place. It may happen to him, as to the other Country-man, who hearing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in his Village of a Monkey which the Biſhop of the neighboring City had, and deſirous to ſee it, having met with an Aſs coming out of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops houſe, he cryed out to his companions they ſhould behold the Biſhops Monkey. If he had bin informed before what the word Monkey did ſignify, he would not have faln into this ridiculous error. To prevent ſuch miſtakes, good Scholars do premiſe ſome notion of the Queſtion <hi>quid ſit,</hi> what is the thing they look for, before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Queſtion <hi>An ſit,</hi> whether ſuch a thing be extant.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe I premiſed a brief diſcourſe touching the quality and notion of Purgatory, and thence proceeded immediatly to examin the grounds exhibited by the Roman Church for the exiſtence of it: But Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> not finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf furniſhed to encounter me this way, takes another, telling us what is of Faith, and what is not touching Purgatory, and then propoſes a ſtock of Arguments in favor of it, which he will have us take for his own, tho very trivial; and falls a quarrelling with other Proteſtants, I know not what, without any mention or regard in the mean time of anſwering my Arguments, according to the foreſaid rule of young School-boys, to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53284:207"/>propoſe one queſtion for anſwer to another.</p>
               <p>But finding the Arguments he produces to be weak for his purpoſe, he tells us that tho the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony be and others do alledge in favor of Purgatory be not convincing, yet their doctrine muſt ſtand, becauſe they are many years in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, and ſo muſt hold while we do not beat them out of it by poſitive proofs, and thence expoſtulates with me that in all my diſcourſe touching Purgatory, I bring no text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that ſays there is no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Sure there is no man of common ſenſe that underſtands the Engliſh Tongue, now ſo enriched with Latin and Schole-terms paſſed into common diſcourſes, but will perceive the ſtrange hallu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emation of this man in his expreſſion now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. It is not for Doctors and Maſters in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities alone, among Englishmen to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the propriety of theſe terms, <hi>affirmative</hi> and <hi>negative,</hi> and the different duties of him that ſtands upon the negative, and of the other that ſtands upon the affirmative in a debate, that it is the latter ought to produce poſitive proofs of what he affirms, and his Adverſary complies with shewing that ſuch proofs are not convincing. To underſtand this much, I ſay, I need not appeal to great Doctors, any man of common underſtanding may be a competent judg in it. What kind of people then, did Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to perſwade, that I did not comply with the duties of a formal Diſputant in refuting the aſſertors of Purgatory, by shewing the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies produced by them were not convincing? My purpoſe was not to prove the exiſtence of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53284:207"/>any thing, but the non-exiſtence of a thing which they call Purgatory. To pretend that a non-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a thing muſt be proved by poſitive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, is to pretend that a non-entity or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be painted with colors.</p>
               <p>He tells us we are Actors, and they defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants in this Controverſy, that it is our part to exhibit proofs. But herein he doth not tell truth. For they are Actors and Impoſers upon us of Articles to which they will force our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. It is their duty to prove that ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is contained in the Word of God. And while they do not, we are in poſſeſſion of our liberty, of which they pretend to rob us, by forcing upon us the belief of Purgatory. He tells us they are a long time in poſſeſſion of this doctrine. Be it ſo, may not a poſſeſſor be queſtioned about the title and right of his poſſeſſion, and diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed if his titles be not found juſtified? This is the caſe betwixt us and them. We pretend their titles for impoſing upon men the belief of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to be invalid and fictitious, they muſt ſhew the contrary or forfeit their poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>The caſe thus ſtanding, you are not to expect Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> to put me off by ſtratagems of Schole-Boys, in returning for anſwer impertinent que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; I muſt keep you to the point, for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in earneſt to find out the truth. The point is, whether the Teſtimonies of Scripture alledged by your Church, for aſſerting Purgatory, be convincing? I ſaid the chief place alledged by it of the old Teſtament is the caſe of <hi>Judas Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabeus,</hi> ſending money to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ſhould be made for his Soldiers defunct.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53284:208"/>Herein you ſay I am miſtaken, you have other Teſtimonies more convincing of your own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. But will you dare to prefer your own judgment to the judgment of your Church, which in her Anniverſary Maſs for the dead, of all Teſtimonies of the old Teſtament, makes choice of the foreſaid place of <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> propoſing it for Epiſtle to be read to the People in that Maſs? Will you have us ſay that your Church made choice of that text beyond others to be read in the Anniverſary Maſs of Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in it is made mention of a weighty ſum of money to be given for the dead, and with offerings of this kind your Clergy is much pleaſed, and ſo do ſtrike on that ſtring too much in their Funeral Sermons, exhorting to mony offerings for the dead, to the no ſmall offence and heavy cenſure of ſuch of your People as dare ſpeak their ſenſe. By what I ſee of your temper, I am ſure you would ſay ſo if you were in my place and caſe. And while you make your atonement with your Church for undervaluing her judgment in the preference of that text, forbear at laſt tergiverſations, and ſtand to a trial of the pertinency of the ſaid text reputed for chief to prove the Exiſtence of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>I ſaid that tho the Book, relating the foreſaid caſe, were Canonical, and of certain Autority (which is not allowed) yet it was no conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing argument to prove the Exiſtence of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſince Praiers for the Dead may be made, and were made to different purpoſes, then that of drawing them out of Purgatory; and if that be ſo, it is not a good conſequence,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53284:208"/>
                  <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> ordered Praiers to be made for his Soldiers defunct; therefore it was to draw them out of Purgatory. That Prayers may be made for the dead to a different purpoſe, then to draw them out of Purgatory, I proved firſt out of a doctrine received among Romiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that God being preſent to all the ſpaces of Eternity, may ſee now and liſten to Praiers that will be made in any Age after, and fore-ſeeing that godly perſons ſhall pray in the future for the aſſiſtance of his Grace to one dying now, may yield it accordingly. If this go well, ſaid I, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may be commendable and very important for the dead, tho no Purgatory were in nature, being conducent to a greater emolument of dying pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently, and thereby eſcaping the everlaſting fire of Hell.</p>
               <p>I have added, that if the caſe related of <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabeus</hi> be true, it is more likely the praiers made for the ſlain, ſhould have proceeded in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid, then for bringing them out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, ſince in the ſame place is related that thoſe men were found to have committed a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin, (which is not pretended to be pardoned in Purgatory) <hi>under the Coats of every one that was ſlain,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Maccab.</hi> XII. 42. <hi>They found things conſecrated to the Idols of the Jamnites, which is forbidden to the Jews by the Law.</hi> And the following Context declares that ſin to have bin hainous, for as much as it drew upon them Gods vengeance, ſaying, that <hi>every man ſaw that this was the cauſe wherefore they were ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> is pleaſed to approve of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of Schole-men, alledged for ground of this
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53284:209"/>reply, that Praiers in the future may avail Souls dying before, to obtain a good death; the only thing I did ſuſpect may not meet with general applauſe, and which indeed, if certain and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly apprehended and believed by men, would make Praiers for the dead to appear more uſeful and important then ever the doctrine of Purgatory could make them yet appear to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious judgments.</p>
               <p>But my good Antagoniſt allowing the ſame doctrine to be very good, tells me it is not to the purpoſe. None is more apt to call one a thief, then he that is a thief himſelf; and none ſo ready to ſay his opponent ſpeaks not to the purpoſe, as one that never ſpeaks to the purpoſe himſelf. Of this latter ſort, I dare make good Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> to be in all his encounters upon my diſcourſe, if it were worth my while; in the mean time I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Reader of common ſenſe, to judg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and me at preſent, which of us both doth ſpeak to the purpoſe, he in ſaying that my diſcourſe now related, is not to the purpoſe of proving the caſe of <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> do's not evince the exiſtence of Purgatory; or I, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thus my Argument to that purpoſe. The Praiers ſuppoſed to be made by the <hi>Maccabees</hi> might have bin, and probably were made to a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent purpoſe, then that of drawing the Souls of their defunct from Purgatory, therefore the caſe of ſuch Praiers to have bin made, doth not evince the exiſtence of Purgatory. The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of this Argument, as alſo the proof and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of it is allowed and commended by my Adverſary. To enlarge upon declaring the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53284:209"/>of the conſequence, is to miſtruſt the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the diſcreet Reader, and to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend my time, which I do not reſolve to do.</p>
               <p>But ſhall we ſee how my ſubtile Adverſary go's about to prove I did not ſpeak to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in my former diſcourſe? For allow, ſaies he, thoſe Praiers made for the ſlain, might have had that effect in this paſſage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a penitent death; yet ſtill returns the concluſion pretended by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi> that the paſſage proves it was the belief and practice of the people of God, and praiſed by Scripture to pray for the expiation of the ſins of the dead. Good Sir, this is to draw breath a little, but not to eſcape a deadly blow given to your cauſe in this occaſion. I take up your own words and make them ſerve my purpoſe thus; Tho that paſſage proves it was the belief and practice of the people of God, and praiſed by Scripture to pray for the expiation of ſins of the the dead, yet ſtill returns my Concluſion, that thoſe Praiers might have bin made for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations of ſins committed by the dead in life, and to be pardoned at their death; not of ſins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining after their death, and bringing them to Purgatory, which was <hi>Bellarmins</hi> purpoſe and yours.</p>
               <p>The Texts he alledges out of St. <hi>Dennis</hi> and <hi>Iſidorus</hi> for praying for the dead, are capable of the ſame conſtruction I gave to the praiers of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> This Anſwer he might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from me if he were in charity, with more ground then the other, he ſuppoſes raſhly I ſhould give, that the Ancient Fathers erred. I did not learn in the Church of <hi>England</hi> to reſpect them
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53284:210"/>leſs. I ſee here far greater reading and regard of them then I ſaw among you. I know no <hi>Gehinus,</hi> or others of thoſe you mention, that aſcribes to them more errors then <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Suarez, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate,</hi> and other your greateſt Schole-men and Scripturians: they alledg them frequently for contradictory opinions; and the one ſide muſt be in an error. You betray too much of a vulgar temper, in admiring it ſhould be ſaid, that any of the Ancient Fathers hath erred. They confeſs themſelves to have don it: it was far from their modeſty and ſincerity to deny it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE chief teſtimony out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, alledged in favor of Purgatory, is that of <hi>Matth.</hi> XII. 32. where our Saviour ſaith, that a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>in this world, nor in the world to come,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſay they, ſome ſins are pardoned in the other world. I denied the conſequence, becauſe out of a Negative a Poſitive do's not follow, as out of this Premiſe, <hi>Joſeph knew not his wife until ſhe had brought forth her firſt born ſon.</hi> This conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence follows not in opinion of good Chriſtians, <hi>therefore he knew her after.</hi> Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> anſwers, this conſequence follows according to the letter of the Text: but the Autority of the Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth to believe it was not ſo; that's to ſay, the Church declares againſt the Text. If you were not tied to this other engagement, you would deem ſuch a ſaying to be a diſ-reſpect to your Church: but hard undertaking puts people to hard ſhifts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was contented to infer the exiſtence of Purgatory out of the foreſaid Text of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> according to the Laws of Prudence, tho not according to the rules of Logic. But Mr.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53284:211"/>
                  <hi>I. S.</hi> as more ſtout, will pretend it to be evident according to rules of Faith and Logic. The Text goes thus, <hi>He that will ſpeak a word againſt the Son of Man, it ſhall be forgiven him, but he that will ſpeak againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the future:</hi> out of which words he argues thus, The Text denies to a blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, what it grants to a blaſphemy againſt the Son of Man, but what it denies to the former is remiſſion in this life and the other; therefore what it grants to the latter, is remiſſion in this life and the other. I anſwer, that the major Propoſition is falſe, for more is denied to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, then allowed to the ſin againſt the Son of Man: for to the former is expreſly denied pardon rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to both worlds, and to the latter pardon is promiſed only indeterminate, and ſo may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with pardoning in one life, tho not in the other. And tho Major and Minor were true, the Conſequence do's not follow, according to rules of Logic, which declare, that where all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are particulars (ſuch are thoſe of that Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm) the Concluſion is not convincent, as in this Syllogiſm, A man ſpeaketh, <hi>Peter</hi> is a man, therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> produces another Argument upon the ſame Text of a ſtrange contexture. Its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſaies he, out of this Text, that as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Spirit is unpardonable, ſo all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins are pardonable; but a blaſphemy againſt the Spirit is unpardonable in this world, and in the future: therefore other ſins are pardonable in both. The Major of this Syllogiſm is falſe;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53284:211"/>firſt, ſince it will have an adequate parit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in both caſes relating to the places of pardon, for which there is no ground in the Text, as declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, touching the Major of the former Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm. Secondly, for ſaying that all other ſins are pardonable, for which neither is there any ground in the Text; ſince from a particular Premiſe an Univerſal Concluſion may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: from ſaying, that a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is not pardonable, it follows not by any rule of Faith or Logic, that all other ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable: for tho that occaſion did require to ſpeak only of a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is, that another ſin may likewiſe be unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable: And I can depoſe, that I ſaw defended in a famous public Diſpute, wherein I had a ſhare my ſelf, that a ſin eſſentially unpardonable is poſſible, and that diſtinct from a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But to make the matter clearer by an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I will let you ſee the frame and force of your Syllogiſm in another of the ſame Contexture, thus; As the King puniſheth Rebels, ſo he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voreth his loial Subjects: he denies to every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel places of truſt and honor in all his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; therefore he allows to every loial Subject places of truſt and honor in all his Domimons. If you do not think this conſequence to be legal, give us leave to think the ſame of your former conſequence, for they are both of the ſame frame. But while you do not ſhew your doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to be built upon firmer grounds then ſuch ſubtilties as theſe; think not to force it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, nor that for being poſſeſſors of it many
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53284:212"/>years, as you ſay, we will judg you therefore to be <hi>bonae fidei poſſeſſores,</hi> or that you poſſeſs it with a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>And whereas the fore-mentioned Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> XII. 32. is in ſo great repute with you for the preſent purpoſe, that you ſay with <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> its the only Text wherewith St. <hi>Bernard</hi> did prove Purgatory. I will declare further by a ſpecial doctrine of a great Father of the Church, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent is the exiſtence of Purgatory to the verity of that Text. The good reception you gave to a ſubtilty of Schole men, I produced for ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing your Argument out of the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> in the Chapter precedent, doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me to hope you may give the like rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to another ſubtilty of a learned and ancient Father of the Church, for anſwering this other Argument out of <hi>Matth.</hi> XII. In the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> we find that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Gibeon</hi> hearing of victorious <hi>Joſhua</hi> his approach, and the rigor he uſed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered places near them, came into him as if they had bin Embaſſadors ſent from forreign Countries to ſollicit his amity: they came in old cloathes, with clouted ſhoes upon their feet, their bread mouldy, and wine bottles old and rent, as if all did ſignifie the tediouſneſs of the journy which they under-went; and by this meens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a promiſe of ſafety and freedom. But after three daies march the Iſraelites found thoſe <hi>Gibeonites</hi> that ſeigned to have come from a forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to be Inhabitants of that Land they were in, complained to <hi>Joſua</hi> of the fraud put upon them:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53284:212"/>but he, not to infringe the oath he made, would not conſent to deſtroy them, but puniſhed their cheat with a note of infamy, ordaining they ſhould be hewers of wood, and drawers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to all the Congregation. Upon which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <hi>Origin</hi> delivers this Gloſs, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> being a type of our Saviour Chriſt, and <hi>Paleſtine</hi> the promiſed Land, a Symbol of Heavenly bliſs: to let people live in that Land with a note of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſignifies that ſome may enter with ſome ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh into the joies of Heaven.

               <p>But I deny your inference from thoſe words of the Creed in favor of your doctrine of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be pertinent. <hi>He deſcended into Hell:</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he did.

I am ſure the more learned and pious men of your Communion will abhor this conſequence. I never heard any of them ſay that deſcent of Chriſt ſhould have bin to Purgatory. Firſt, becauſe under the notion of Hell they never underſtood Purgatory. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you mean he ſhould deſcend thither ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pains of that place, its no leſs blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous then that you call Blaſphemy in Calvin; for if we believe your Authors, the pains of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory are the ſame with thoſe of Hell, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the ſame Miniſters of divine Juſtice,

               </head>
               <p>WHEN firſt I came to examin the grounds of the doctrine of Indulgence uſed in the Roman Church, I confeſs I was aſtoniſhed to ſee how little ground they could ſhew in the Fountains of divine Faith for this myſtery of the Romiſh belief, of ſo great noiſe and ſo much uſe among them. I thought it a ſtrong nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive argument againſt ſuch a dectrine, not to be contained in the Word of God; that two ſo great Champions of the Roman Church, <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> both emploied by public authority to defend this doctrine, ſhould not meet with any convincing teſtimony of it in divine Scripture, as both do confeſs plainly. Both do examine the two chief Teſtimonies alledged for this doctrine: the firſt out of <hi>John</hi> 20.23. <hi>Whoſe ſoever ſins you remitt, they are remitted to them.</hi> The ſecond out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever you ſhall looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> And both do acknowledg them not to convince the doctrine of Indulgences as now practiſed in the Roman Church. <hi>Cajetan, tom.</hi> 1. <hi>opuſc. tract.</hi> 8. <hi>q.</hi> 4. ſays the foreſaid teſtimonies are without doubt to be underſtood of a remiſſion to be given
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53284:215"/>by way of Sacraments, not of the remiſſion of pains in the other life, as the Pope doth pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the giving of Indulgences, and finally gives for the only reaſon the Authority of the Church, and of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> then governing, which he tells us muſt ſuffice, tho no other reaſon ſhould appear, by theſe remarkable words, <hi>Abſque ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatione aliquâ etiamſi nulla adeſſet ratio fatendum eſt dicti Theſauri diſpenſationem non ſolùm per Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenta, quoad merita Chriſti, ſed aliter quam per Sacramenta, qnoad merita Chriſti &amp; Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum commiſſam eſſe Praelatis Eccleſiae, &amp; praecipuè Papae, &amp; hoc tanto magis fatendum eſt quanto per</hi> Leonem <hi>decimum determinatum eſt.</hi> 
                  <q>We are to believe without ſtaggering (tho no reaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for it) that the diſpenſing of the Treaſure of the Church not only by way of Sacraments as to the merits of Chriſt, but otherwiſe then by Sacraments, as to the merits of Chriſts and the Saints, is committed to the Prelates of the Church, and eſpecially to the Pope. And this is ſo much the more to be confeſſed, becauſe it is ſo determined by <hi>Leo</hi> X.</q> A very ſpecial reaſon to convince <hi>Luther,</hi> and the reſt of the World, that do not believe the Pope to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>

Of that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. he ſays the ſame that <hi>Cajetan,</hi> above mentioned. Of the other touching the power of binding and looſing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. he ſays the literal ſenſe of thoſe words to be the power of binding by Laws and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53284:216"/>Cenſures, and of abſolving from Cenſures and diſpenſing in Laws. And finally in the number 17. of the ſame Section, he concludes, there is no place in the Goſpel whence the giving of this power may be concluded, if it be not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.16. where our Savior ſaid to S. <hi>Peter, feed my Sheep,</hi> in which words <hi>Suarez</hi> doth pretend the power Univerſal, and Supremacy over all the Church to have bin given to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and under that Univerſalïty the power of Indulgences to have bin given to him.

               <p>But tho ſuch a Supremacy would have bin granted to the Pope, and to the ſucceeding Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> farr muſt <hi>Suarez</hi> go for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the doctrine of Indulgences to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from ſuch a grant. If the power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing thoſe immenſe Treaſures of the merits of Chriſt and all Saints was given to S. <hi>Peter</hi> in thoſe words of our Savior, commending to him the feeding of his Sheep, how came he, and the other ſucceeding Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> for ſo many
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53284:216"/>Ages, to neglect the uſe of this power to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Souls, and great advantage of the Roman Church, as now is practiſed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suarez</hi> did eaſily perceive the weakneſs of his argument from this teſtimony, and ſo betook himſelf in the ſecond Section following to the common refuge of the uſe and autority of the Church. That there is ſuch a uſe, ſays he, is not denied; we ſee it: that it is not an abuſe but a lawful uſe is proved, firſt, by the authority of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> laſt Seſſion, where is added that this uſe hath bin approved by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of ſacred Councils, for which purpoſe are wont to be related, the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> Can. 11. of <hi>Carthage,</hi> 4.75. of <hi>Neooaeſarea,</hi> ch. 3. of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Can 1.2. but in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, ſays <hi>Suarez, we only find that it was lawful for Biſhops to remit ſome of the public Penitences enjoined by Canons for divers crimes: but that ſuch a remiſſion ſhould be extended to a pardon of penalties due in the Tribunal of God, may not be inferred from thoſe Councils.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>From theſe latter words, <hi>in the perſon of Chriſt,</hi> they pretend to infer that the practice of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences now uſed in the Roman Church had its beginning from Chriſt, and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did practiſe it in the occalion now mentioned by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53284:217"/>received from Chriſt. This Argument <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> propoſes in the above mentioned ſecond Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>num.</hi> 3. but from the following fourth Number to the 11. he doth moſt vigorouſly prove the inefficaciouſneſs of that argument. That the remiſſion given by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to that inceſtuous man, did only relate to an exterior penalty due by courſe or Canon of Eccleſiaſtical Government, not to penalties of the other life depending from Divine Juſtice, that the words <hi>in the perſon of Chriſt</hi> only proves it to be an act of Juriſdiction, or power received from Chriſt, which may be ſufficiently verified by a remiſſion of an exterior temporal penalty due by the common courſe of Eccleſiaſtical human power: and finally concludes that there is no warrantable hiſtory or teſtimony extant, by which it may be convinced, that the practiſe of Indulgences now uſed in the Roman Church was known before the times of <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, of whom he ſays is reported, that he gave a Plena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y Indulgence: <hi>tho even of this,</hi> ſays <hi>Suarez, I find no written Hiſtory, but a public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in</hi> Rome, <hi>and other places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And finally, what <hi>Suarez</hi> ſays with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is only that this practiſe is now in uſe in the Church, ſo as they are reputed heretics who reprehend ſuch a cuſtome, and it is impoſſible that the Univerſal Church ſhould err herein; for it were, ſays he, an intolerable moral error in practiſe. If the Univerſal Church, indeed, did practiſe now, and always from the beginning and in all places this cuſtom, according to the rules of Apoſtolic lawful Tradition delivered by <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinenſis</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> l. 4. <hi>de Baptiſmo, cap.</hi> 24.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53284:217"/>we would look upon this argument as of force. But <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelf doth acknowledg and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that this practiſe is neither ſo ancient nor Univerſal. And therefore it may not be taken for Apoſtolic tradition, but ranked among the modern Inſtitutions of the preſent Romiſh Church, to ſtand or fall with the autority of it; which we have ſufficiently proved not to be infallible. And by this (Reader) you may ſee, how raſhly Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> ſays I did moſt falſly aver, that <hi>Suarez</hi> is not ſo certain, whether the power of abſolving given to the Church did extend to the profuſe grant of Indulgences practiſed at preſent by the Roman Church. Let the Learned Reader reflect upon <hi>Suarez</hi> his diſcourſe upon this ſubject in the place forementioned, and he ſhall find how farr he is from any certainty that this doctrine is grounded upon Scripture and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Antiquity, but ſhall find that he only believes it, as <hi>Scotus</hi> did that of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Non propter rationes quae non cogunt,</hi> not in force of arguments alledged for it, which are not convincing, but for the autority of his Church.</p>
               <p>And mark, Reader, that ſo great men as <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> being employed by public autority in defending this doctrine, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing all their Learning, and no ſmall labor in procuring to eſtabliſh it, we find them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they have nothing to ſay ſeriouſly for it, but what the Collier for his Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that he believed as the Church believes. And here alſo they miſtake the true notion of the Church and autority of it; a miſtake, in truth, more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53284:218"/>in a Collier, then in men of the Learning and repute of <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Suarez.</hi> But ſuch is the condition of their cauſe, that it could not be defended better; and ſuch was their enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, that they muſt defend it by right or wrong.

               <p>IN the 90<hi rend="sup">th</hi> page of my former Diſcourſe, ſpeaking of the Antiquity of Indulgences, I mentioned, that the firſt notice I had of the grants of them, after the manner now uſed, is that of <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII. given to thoſe of his party who would fight againſt the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> III. (by error of the Printer IV.) in the year 1084. which <hi>Baronius</hi> relates from his Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary, in which was promiſed remiſſion of all their ſins, to ſuch as would venture their lives in that holy War, for which I quoted <hi>Baronius</hi> his Annals upon the foreſaid year 1084. <hi>num.</hi> 15. Here Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> enters in triumph, and declares, that if I have no more skill in Divinity, or moral Theology, then I ſeem to have in Hiſtory, I am but a freſh-water Scholar: as for Controverſie, ſaies he, my Treatiſe ſhews well what I know of it. Be it ſo Sir, let me have truth on my ſide, as I hope will appear by this Treatiſe, and make you much of your skill: in the mean while let us examine, how much it is in the preſent point of Hiſtory wherein you pretend to be moſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial. Firſt, you miſtake moſt abſurdly the ſtate of the Queſtion, as is uſual with you, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53284:219"/>where I ſpeak of Indulgences <hi>given by</hi> Gregory <hi>the Seventh, to thoſe of his party who would fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperor</hi> Henry <hi>the Third,</hi> you report ſuch Indulgences to be given by the ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi> to <hi>Henry,</hi> to encourage him and the Chriſtians to war againſt the <hi>Saracens.</hi> Whoever did read the Hiſtory of that <hi>Gregory,</hi> and his fierce perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid Emperor to the end of his life, even as his own Hiſtorians, <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> more biaſſed to him, do report; will more eaſily believe, that <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhould favor the <hi>Turk</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Henry,</hi> then uphold <hi>Henry</hi> againſt any Adverſary. If ever you had any tincture of the Hiſtory of Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, how could you fall into ſo ridiculous an equivocation, as to conceive him granting Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences in favor of the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> III. If you did read my Diſcourſe ſpeaking expreſly of an Indulgence granted to thoſe that would fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Emperor, how come you to pervert the narrative ſo abſurdly, as if I ſhould have ſpoken of an Indulgence given in favor of that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>You ſay that the Indulgence I ſpeak of, nor any other to any ſuch purpoſe, was not granted by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, but by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Second.

You ſpeak of Indulgences granted by <hi>Leo</hi> the Third, <hi>anno</hi> 847. but it was not <hi>Leo</hi> the Third, but <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth that reigned then, and when <hi>Suarez</hi> finds not him, nor any other, giving Indulgences of ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient date, ſure I am, you never found them upon any warrantable account.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXX. <hi>Of the ſtrange and abſurd terms uſed in the grants of Indulgences, and the immoderate profuſeneſs wherewith, and ſlight cauſes for which they are granted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TRuly if we do conſider the abſurd language uſed in the trade of Indulgences, and the vaſt boundleſs profuſeneſs in the grant of them for very ſlight cauſes, of all which their moſt learned Defenders do confeſs not to be able to give a rational account, we may with ſome grounds ſuſpect, that ſome ſuch Lay-cardinals mentioned in the precedent Chapter out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> granting Indulgences in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould have bin the Authors and Inventors of the preſent practice of Indulgences, and terms of it uſed in the Roman Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt they divide Indulgences into <hi>total</hi> and <hi>partial.</hi> A total Indulgence is a full remiſſion of all the temporal pains due to the mans ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A partial Indulgence is a remiſſion of a part of the penalties, according to the will of the perſon granting it. A <hi>total Indulgence</hi> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided again into <hi>plena, plenior &amp; pleniſſima,</hi> a plenary or full, more full, and moſt full. Here the wits of the Learned are ſtrained to find ſenſe in theſe words, how one Indulgence that is ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary can be capable of theſe degrees of increaſe in regard of the ſame perſon. If by any plenary
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53284:221"/>Indulgence, he has a total remiſſion of all the penalties due to his ſins, how can he have a more total or full remiſſion of them? <hi>Suarez, diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>De effectu Indulgent. Sect.</hi> 4. finding no ground for theſe degrees, would fain give ſome ſenſe to them by a parity of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> full of grace by the coming of the Angel, more full by the coming of her Son, and moſt full in her death: but finding himſelf weary of ſuch bare conjectures, reſolves that according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate there is no ſubſtantial difference, as to the effect in thoſe gradations of plenary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, whatſoever was the meaning of thoſe terms with the firſt Authors of them, whereof at preſent there is no clear knowledg, and relates <hi>Sotus</hi> ſaying, that Preachers of Indulgences have introduced thoſe gradations by way of exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partial Indulgences</hi> are likewiſe ſubdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>quadragena, ſeptena, carena,</hi> and the like. <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragena</hi> they call an Indulgence of forty daies, <hi>ſeptena,</hi> of ſeven years, <hi>carena,</hi> compoſed of both the former, containing ſeven years and forty daies. And now enters a very perplex difficulty that turns the brains of their ableſt Divines, what to underſtand by theſe years and daies of remiſſion, whether ſo many years and daies of the pains of Purgatory to be remitted, as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerius</hi> did conceive, or ſo much time of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance enjoined by Canons for ſins: and tho this latter be the more received and common opinion, and approved by <hi>Suarez</hi> in the place now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet he finds ſo many difficulties for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous ſenſe of ſo many thouſand years allowed
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53284:221"/>by Indulgences, ſo little conſiſtence in reaſons alledged by ſeveral Authors, that he reſolves, its a matter obſcure and unknown to us, and that we muſt reſt upon the judgment of the Church which knows the meaning of thoſe meaſures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thus, <hi>Breviter vero aſſero, de re nobis incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tà Authores hos diſputare, Eccleſiam vero uti illa menſurâ quae ſibi nota eſt.</hi> I ſay briefly, that theſe Authors do quarrel about a thing unknown to us, and that the Church uſes herein that meaſure which is known to it ſelf, remitting thoſe pains of Purgatory, which may be proportionable to the penalties of this life enjoined by Canons; and ſo leaves us as wiſe as we were before, for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what ſenſe ſo many thouſands of years can have, whether relating to the pains of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, or to penalties enjoined by Canons. But this Language is uſed and received in the Roman Church, and therefore we muſt ſtand to it, let it mean what it will, be it ſenſe or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe; and that's all the account that <hi>Suarez</hi> can give us of it after the trial of his own wit, and examining the diſcourſes of others, being to ſpeak in earneſt.</p>
               <p>Now to the cauſe of giving Indulgences, Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> gives us occaſion to ſay ſomthing, ſince he boaſts, that Indulgences are not granted ſo ſlightly as Proteſtant Miniſters would make their flock believe. Its true that <hi>Cajetan</hi> teaches, <hi>Opuſc. de Indulgent. cap.</hi> 8. that great Indulgences ought not to be given for ſmall cauſes, and that there ought to be a proportion betwixt the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Indulgence, and the work performed to obtain it. But how can this conſiſt with what
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53284:222"/>
                  <hi>Cajetan</hi> tells there? that a plenary Indulgence is given to every one that ſtands in the Yard of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, when the Pope gives his bleſſing to the people there on <hi>Eaſter</hi> day. Here he recurs to a myſtery, that tho to ſtand in that place be of its own nature of no great conſideration, yet relating to the purpoſe of repreſenting the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church united under one head, its of great weight, and proportioned to the Indulgence received. But what myſtery ſhall we find to render decent that famous Indulgence granted by <hi>Innocent</hi> III. to all ſuch as would marry public Harlots? as <hi>Spondanus</hi> relates in the year 1198.</p>
               <p>Who would not think that ſo many loud and learned cries made againſt the abuſes of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences in the Roman Church for more then a hundred years, and the ſcandal and contemt of them grown among the ſober and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men even of their own party, would not be a means to moderate at leaſt the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs profuſeneſs of thoſe grants, feeding conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the hopes of ſinners for a remiſſion of all their crimes, and encouraging them to perſevere in their wicked waies? But that's the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Church, and the diſmal ſymptom of a diſeaſe being mortal, that it grows worſe with remedies, and hates a cure. Setting aſide num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs inſtances of their moſt abſurd prodigalities in this kind, whereof many Books are repleniſh'd, I will only ſet down here a Copy of Indulgences granted by the preſent Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Tenth, upon the occaſion of Canon zing certain new Saints of late, in which you may ſee a full <hi>Idea</hi> of the Romiſh corruptions in this kind.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53284:226"/>apt to be conceived by the moſt wicked livers, a ſecurity is given of remiſſion of all ſins, tho never ſo grievous and repeated, and of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pains due to them: and likewiſe all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral penalties following them, are remitted by a plenary Indulgence, ſo eaſy to be obtained as we have ſeen.

               <head>CHAP. XXXI. <hi>The diſmal unhappineſs of the Romiſh people in having their Liturgy in a Tongue unknown to them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>EX ore tuo te judico ſerve nequam,</hi> thus begins Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his anſwer to my diſcourſe upon this ſubject, wherein I lamented the miſery of the Romiſh People, in having their Liturgy in a tongue unknown to them; and thus alſo ſhall my reply to him begin, which certainly will be to put the Saddle on the right Horſe. What is it S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> that I have ſaid which may be a judgment againſt my ſelf in this caſe? That the purpoſe of nature by ſpeaking is to communicate the ſenſe of him that ſpeaks to the hearer, which cannot be obtained if the hearer perceives not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words he ſpeaks. This ſay you proves againſt my ſelf; for in the Liturgy or public Service of the Church we ſpeak to God, and not to the Congregation, and God can underſtand us, tho we do not our ſelves. But ſtay S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, is not the Liturgy, or public Service of the Church as well with you, as with us, compoſed of an exchange of ſpeech betwixt God and his People, they ſpeaking to him in Praiers and Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, he ſpeaking to them by the Leſſons of ſacred Scripture, by the Epiſtles, Goſpels and Pſalms? Is it not neceſſary for both theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53284:227"/>that the People ſhould underſtand what they ſay to God by Prayer, and what he ſays to them by Exhortation? And for the firſt, wherein you think your pretenſion to be obtained, for praying, I ſay; is not Praier a rational and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Elevation of the mind, helped by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and ſenſe of the Praier read or ſaid? Is not this elevation of the mind mainly advanced by underſtanding the word of the Praier read or ſaid? whoever heard a Pſalm ſung with ſolemn Muſic, may well tell how different a feeling and elevation of mind he hath when he ſees or knows the words ſung and the meaning of them, then when he hears the ſame Pſalm without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the words or ſenſe of them.</p>
               <p>Your compariſon of a Polander preſenting a Petition in Engliſh to the King of <hi>England,</hi> which himſelf doth not underſtand, doth ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate your crime, and publiſh the miſery of the People abuſed by you. Would not that Polander wiſh to know the Engliſh tongue for acting in his own cauſe, and to be ſure he was not abuſed by a Notary, who poſſibly might have framed a Petition for him to the King for hanging his Father or Mother for Traitors. If the King did underſtand the Poliſh Language as well as the Engliſh, were it not a madneſs in the ſaid Polander to have his Petition penn'd in a Tongue he doth not underſtand with the foreſaid diſadvantages, being able to do it in his own Tongue with the contrary advantages? What madneſs then is it in your People to frame their Praiers in a Tongue unknown to them, to ſpeak like Parrots, without feeling or knowing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53284:228"/>what they ſay, and expoſed to the danger of being abuſed by a knave, teaching them, or reading before them blaſphemous words, in which they are to join with him b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their <hi>Amen?</hi> And in caſe the Praier be good that is read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, what proportion can it have with elevating the minds of the People to a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in ſenſe with the Miniſter, if they do not underſtand what he ſays? And thus ill it go's with you, even for the act of praying in your Liturgy, which you allow to be an elevation of the mind to God. Even in this point I have your own judgement againſt you, and ſo may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn your text upon you, ſaying, <hi>Ex ore tuo te judico ſerve nequam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what of the ſecond part of the Liturgy above mentioned, containing a ſpeech of God to the People by the Epiſtles, Goſpels, Pſalms, and other ſacred Lectures directed to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual direction and food of their Souls? can this end be compaſſed without ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the People of what is ſaid to them? You confeſs that S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. prohibits preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the People in a Tongue unknown to them: and are not thoſe ſacred Lectures a kind of preaching, exhortation, and inſtruction of the People, and the beſt that can be, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding immediatly from God himſelf? Then you act againſt the Apoſtles order, by your own confeſſion, propoſing ſuch exhortations to the People in a Tongue unknown to them, and ſo your text returns upon you here in full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Ex ore tuo te judico ſerve nequam.</hi> It is a diſcredit to a cauſe ſo clear to make more delay
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53284:228"/>upon it: but let the World cry againſt the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny you uſe this way with Souls in depriving them of their Spiritual food. What you ſay of ſubmitting your judgment herein to the Church, is idle and abſurd, when our preſent buſineſs is to rebuke the abuſes and corruptions of your Church, the cauſes of our diſlike of it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXXII. <hi>The cruelty of the Roman Church in prohibiting the reading of Scripture to the people, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pretence of Sects and Diviſions ariſing among Proteſtants refuted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FRom the page 101. of my former Diſcourſe, I declared the cruelty uſed with the faithful people in prohibiting them the reading of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is the food of their Souls; how contrary that is to the doctrine of Scripture it ſelf, often inviting us to the reading of it, and to the doctrine and practice of the Fathers, and people of the Primitive Church.</p>
               <p>To all which Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> replies, that the fruit we have in the Proteſtant Church of permitting the people to read the Bible, is the variety of Sects ſprung from the reading of it. But this you may tell better to others, then to me that know now matters go on both ſides, and am certain that there are more diviſions in ſeveral Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your Communion both in Doctrine and in Ceremonies, then in the Proteſtant Church. He that knows the differences of opinions betwixt Jeſuiſts and Dominicans, each one condemning the other of hereſie, and doctrines deſtructive of good life, and of the merits of Chriſt, and the great difference in Rites and Ceremonies uſed among them, will clearly ſee they differ more in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53284:229"/>all the one from the other, then the Orthodox Proteſtants do from any other Congregation of Chriſtians in the Reformed Church. Their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are not in matters ſo fundamental and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation and a good Life, as thoſe of the diſſenting Romiſh Societies. Their cenſures of one another are not ſo heavy; yea the very ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Queſtions on both ſides do declare ſo much; both ſuppoſing, they are touching things indifferent; the Diſſenters or Non-conformiſts, pretending that the points in Debate, being only Ceremonial and indifferent, not eſſential to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or good life, ought not to be forced upon them: The Orthodox alledging that very thing to render Diſſenters criminal, that the things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered being of their own nature indifferent, and not oppoſite to Gods Law, there is a neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them of obeying lawful Autority ordering ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>So much we may ſay in relation to Rites and Ceremonies, that there is not near ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in them uſed by Orthodox Proteſtants, and other Congregations diſſenting; as there is in the Ceremonies and Rites uſed in Colledges of Jeſuites, and Convents of Dominicans, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites, Franciſcans, Carthuſians, and other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Societies differing both in Habit, Diet, Rites and Ceremonies one from the other. All theſe differences both of Doctrine and Rites the Pope can wink at, provided they agree in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to him, and advancing his quarrel. The great Union required by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> makes meaner diſſentions appear more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and greater would the Diſſentions and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53284:230"/>be, if the light of holy Scriptures were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; for St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, that infinite evils do ariſe from ignorance of Scripture: from hence, ſaith he, moſt part of Hereſies have come; and ſo they are of their own nature, and well uſed not a cauſe of Diſſentions and Errors, but a cure of them. And therefore the Roman Church being reſolved not to be cured of her corruptions, decreed the Scriptures to be removed from the eies of the people; as appears by the Council of Biſhops mentioned by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and by other grave Writers, of whoſe Autority you doubt. And what need we the Autority of that Council for a thing that we ſee with our eies, and ordered by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> by <hi>Pius</hi> IV. <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. and <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII. in the places alledged in the page 100. of my former Diſcourſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIII. <hi>Mr. I S. his Engagement, touching the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and the practice of Confeſſion confuted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FOR inſtance of the cruelty of the Romiſh Church, in preſſing upon the belief of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things uncertain and repugnant to their judgment, I made a brief mention of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> how they make people ſwear to defend it, and debar from offices and preferment ſuch as will not take ſuch oaths. And Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> muſt enter into a formal diſpute upon the point. The teſtimony of S. <hi>Paul</hi> (ſaying, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. that <hi>all men ſinned in Adam,</hi> and conſequently the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> with the reſt) he values nothing. <hi>It is a general rule,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>capable of exception;</hi> but gives us no teſtimony to prove the Virgin was excepted from that rule. He admits that Chriſt was Univerſal Redeemer, and died for all men, but thinks it not a conſequence that the Virgin ſhould have bin redeemed, or drawn, but only preſerved from ſin, and ſo the conſequence of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not legal, ſaying, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 14. <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead;</hi> or if if it be legal, ſure the Virgin was dead by Original ſin as the reſt, or elſe all were not dead.</p>
               <p>You ſay it is not unlawful in a community to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53284:231"/>require certain conditions from ſuch as will be members of it, and ſo may require of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to defend the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> To demand conditions not including a diſturbance of conſcience, nor occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning diſſimilations may be lawful; not ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire conditions contrary to a mans conſcience and judgment, which was our caſe. You ſay the Oath of Supremacy, in opinion of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is an hereſie, why then is it required from me? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is only folly or malice can make it appear ſuch, as I have declared in the 18. Chapter, and the Law is not to be regulated by ſuch paſſions.</p>
               <p>I gave likewiſe a ſhort touch to the cruelty uſed with conſciences in the practice of Conſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as well in the manner of its exerciſe, as the frequent reſervation of caſes. And here Mr. <hi>I.S.</hi> muſt enter again into the deep of the diſpute, whether Confeſſion ought to be admitted, which was not the caſe; in as much as the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not only admit, but commend and enjoin the practice of Confeſſion in neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, tho not the unneceſſary and pernicious ſuperſtructures of the Roman Church, touching the mode preſcribed, and the reſervation of caſes, occaſioning lamentable perplexities, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate melancholies of Souls, whereof I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare miſerable inſtances, if certain due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations did not make me ſuperſede enlarging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this kind of matter.</p>
               <p>Only I will reflect upon a new addition of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> brought in by Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> of which he will have St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> to be Author, that the quality of the ſin, the place, time, continuance, and diverſity of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53284:231"/>perſons muſt be ſpecified. This makes me doubt and wonder what kind of perſon my Antagoniſt is, whether ever he was bred among learned men of the Roman Church, or did read their Books; for certainly any of them that has but the leaſt tincture of moral Theology, will think ſtrange of this paradox, That the place and time of ſins are to be declared, as alſo the diverſity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, being of the ſame kind or ſpecies. But of theſe kind of lapſes Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his Theology makes no ſcruple; if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e were better acquainted with the practice of Doctors in the Roman Church, he would not fetch up doctrines of Fathers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the preſent practice of that Church. If he did but ſit certain hours of the day from St. <hi>Lukes</hi> to <hi>May-day,</hi> or thereabouts, in the Halls of Divinity of the Colledges of <hi>Palentia</hi> and <hi>Tudela,</hi> where he ſaies no Divinity was ever taught, he would learn, that it is not the duty of a Penitent to ſpecifie in his Confeſſion the time, place and diverſity of perſons, wherein and wherewith his ſins were committed; and they would tell him, that if St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it was one of his errors, and a doctrine now out of date. But Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> is of a ſtronger ſtomach, can ſwallow by the groſs, and cares not ſo much for chawing or mincing diſtinctions of doctrines.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> concludes his Book as he began, and did proceed in it, pouring out a ſhower of falſities, non ſenſe, impertinences, and hallu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinations, of which I will give ſome teſtimonies here, whereby the Reader may ſee, with how much reaſon I may reſolve not to ſpend precious time in further anſwering to, or taking notice of ſuch faulty writings. The very firſt words of his Dedicatory Epiſtle to the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> contains a heap of the ſaid faults and falſities. He calls his Book <hi>A Vindication of both Churches, which a viper has endeavoured to bite, &amp;c.</hi> he may better call it an affront of both Churches: of the Proteſtant, for the rude inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries offer'd to her, of the Popiſh for having no better defenſe of her cauſe to exhibit. With what truth or propriety can he ſay, that I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd to bite both Churches? As for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, I gave ſufficient teſtimony of my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to make the world know, that in her is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53284:232"/>the true Primitive, Catholic, Apoſtolic Faith, and therefore is the ſureſt way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as for the Roman Church, from which I received the belief of a Chriſtian, if the matter be well conſidered, I will make good I have not bin a Viper, but a dutiful and truly loving Child, and more dutiful and true then Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> If a Mother infected with a peſtilent canker had two ſons, of which the one knowing the remedy would apply it, tho with reluctancy and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the infected Mother; and the other not to diſpleaſe his Mother, would feed the ſickneſs with lenitives or ſoothing, pleaſing the Mother, but feaſtering her wound, and haſtening her ruine; which of both do you think were the more truly dutiful and loving Child? Certainly the former, who would apply a healing hand to the Mother tho againſt her will. This is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and me. I ſaw that Mother (at whoſe breaſt I did ſuck the belief of a Chriſtian, and therefore cannot chuſe but revere and love her as a Mother) ſicken of a peſtilent canker, I tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to apply ſome beginnings of a remedy, and finding her impatient of cure, while in her reach, I betook me to a diſtance whence I might apply the cure, letting her know, that her Innocations proceeding from Ambition and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She ſhould return therefore to her former innocency and holineſs, practiced by St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors for many Ages, which rendred them glorious and venerable to all the world, when their ſtudy was not to make Princes of Nephews and Nieces; and of Peaſants, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes;

               <p>What ſhall I ſay of his pitiful ſpite and envy in his Preface to the Reader, pretending to rob me of thoſe titles my Emploiments gave me ſo public and known (as appears in the Preface of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53284:233"/>of this Treatiſe) without ſhame to be convinced of palpable untruths? What of his raſhneſs and rudeneſs in fixing for a Theſis or Title to the eighth Chapter of his Book, <hi>That the Proteſtant Church is not the Church of Chriſt, nor any part of it; that they cannot without Blaſphemy alledg Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for their Tenets?</hi> Of his proſane policy, in accuſing me of indiſcretion in delivering what I knew to be truth, touching the Salvation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants when I was on the Romiſh ſide, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the fourteenth Chapter? What of his blaſphemous impiety, in ſaying, that <hi>no Text of Scripture tells us, that the Evangeliſts were in the ſtate of Grace when they wrote the Goſpel, nor nothing elſe gives us aſſurance of it?</hi> Nay further againſt the Goſpel it ſelf he pronounceth this horrible Blaſphemy, <hi>That not only we are unſure of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Goſpel, but that we are aſſured it is not infallible.</hi> And this helliſh conception of his own he muſt father upon the Proteſtant Church, ſaying, its the common doctrine of it, that <hi>it is impoſſible to keep Gods Commandments:</hi> the falſehood of which mali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53284:234"/>common opinion of Romiſh Divines, that the Image of God and Chriſt is to be adored by the worſhip of <hi>Latria,</hi> as above mentioned, Ch. 23.</p>
               <p>What of his terrible Hallucination in matter of Hiſtory touching Indulgences declared in Chapt. 29. appearing in every word ridiculouſly miſtaken, when he pretends to be moſt magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial in correcting miſtakes of his Adverſary? And carrying on conſtantly to the end this ſpirit of Untruth, Hallucination, and Impropriety of terms, he concludes his Book with telling me, I know in my conſcience the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not guilty of the errors I attribute to her for cauſe of my ſeparation from her. How came you S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to know the interior ſtate of my conſcience? You tell me I know the Popes Supremacy in temporal affairs over Princes was no article of Faith, but a Schole queſtion. That the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility was but an opinion of ſome Divines. As to the Popes Supremacy I have declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>c.</hi> 25. what little comfort is left to Princes by that diſtinction of the Popes Supremacy in ſpirituals from that of his power in temporals, whereas he backs his ſpiritual power with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral to the ruin and depoſing of all Princes and Emperors that reſiſt him. The only caſe of furious <hi>Hildebrand</hi> with the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, as related by his own moſt friendly Hiſtorians, even <hi>Baronius,</hi> is apt to ſtrike a horror into any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, and a terror into Princes and people, if the unſpeakable arrogance of the Roman Court ſhould not be bridled.</p>
               <p>As for the Popes Infallibility, I have declared above in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chapter how impertinent your
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53284:234"/>diſtinction of Pope alone from Pope and his Council together, is, to eſcape the force of my Arguments in the preſent Controverſy. How falſly you ſay I ſhould ſpeak only of the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Pope alone, my Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he is fallible ſtill, whether alone, or in a Council depending upon him, as that of <hi>Trent.</hi> You tell me I left the Roman Church, becauſe I ſaw the Bible prohibited in it to the People, and the Liturgy performed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Language. But tho that is a great crime of the Roman Church (as I have declared in the precedent Chapter) it was not the only cauſe; others ſeveral grievous I produced more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly touching my own concern and daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, wherein I could not continue with quiet or ſafety of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>You tell me I forſook a Church honored with many Saints, <hi>for the Proteſtant Church, whereof there was never yet any Saint.</hi> If this be true, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles were no Saints, for I am certainly perſwaded they were of the Church that I am of: their Doctrine and their Faith and no other being taught in it. But you ſpeak with the vulgar of Proteſtants as condiſtinct from Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics. Well, and how come you to know that none of them was ever a Saint? Were you in the hearts of all, or did you ſit in the Tribunal of God, to know what degree of grace they had in his Soveraign inſcrutable judgement? What is raſhneſs if this be not? But you have titular Saints who have purchaſed that calling by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic authority, as Dukes, Earls, and Knights
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53284:235"/>do purchaſe theirs: of ſuch we have none. Then you ſpeak of titular Saints, not of real ones, and upon this account you may not expect to win me from the Proteſtant Church to yours. I hear of ſome Sectaries about us, I know not where, who ſtyle all of their Congregation Saints; to this degree of Sanctity your Church did not aſpire yet: then, if I am to remove to a Church of more titular Saints, to theſe Sectaries I am to go, not to you. But you ſpeak of Saints that come to Heaven, and thither none may come but under the conduct of the Roman Pope; he hath the keys of Heaven, and none may go thither without his leave. I heard of ſome Popes that were kept out themſelves from entring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I have great reaſon to believe it was ſo, and to fear that I following their conduct may have the like repulſe. It is one of your damnable errors, and not the leaſt cauſe of my diſcontent with you, to ſay <hi>that none may be ſaved without paying obedience to the Pope of</hi> Rome, a ſpark of Hell-fire, which kindled and conſerves the miſerable combuſtions and diſtractions of Chriſtendom, the bloody Maſſacre of ſo many thouſands of Men, and the deſolation of ſo many noble Kingdoms and Provinces; a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Paradox cut out to the meaſure of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable Ambition of the Roman Pope and his Court, to force all the World with the fright of everlaſting fire, adding to it the power of the Sword where he can, to reſign up their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and contribute their wealth and liberties to the ſupport of that power and grandeur, the greateſt that ever was entertained in the fancy
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53284:235"/>of man, if men were ſo mad as to yield to the propoſals of the Pope and his Emiſſaries.</p>
               <p>To diminiſh the heat of this helliſh Ambition, the Seminary of the miſeries of Chriſtendom, I have contributed with my endeavors, even while I was among you, uſing only the armor of principles learned in your own Scholes, and declaring that the practiſe of the Emiſſary Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants of the Roman Court is contrary, not only to the intrinſic rules of Chriſtian doctrine, but to the very profeſſed tenets of the Romiſh Church; I do not ſay of the Romiſh Court, for tho both corrupt, they have their different waies, and to conform with the tenets of the Roman Church was not thought ſufficient in me, if I did not alſo faſhion my doctrine to the intereſt of the Roman Court, and to the extenſion of the grandeur of it; which is the want of policy or prudence Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> accuſed me of, as before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>I will continue now with more liberty and reſolution the ſame endeavors, of letting the World know how falſe and pernicious this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is; how great the diſingenuity of Romiſh Emiſſaries in publiſhing and preaching it to the People, contrary to truth and their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, to win Proſelytes by frights to the Romiſh faction; but it ſhall be in the Schole language and ſtyle, to make it more univerſal, not in the Vulgar, to ſhun dealing with quiblers and cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ſuch as I find you to be, Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> What you are in your perſon, I know not certainly, but your ſtyle and mode of diſcourſe faſhioned to a vulgar humor, with a total neglect of what
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53284:236"/>learned and ſerious men may think of it, makes me conceive you may be one of thoſe Preachers I ſaw in Pulpits, with a dead mans skull in their hand, or the picture of a Devil, or a damned Soul ſurrounded with flames, and girded with Snakes and Toads, moving the Vulgar with tragic cries and antic geſtures to ſighs and ſobs, and knocking of their breaſts; while thoſe of more ſenſe and diſcretion did exerciſe their patience, and bite their lips to refrain laughing at ſhowers of non-ſenſe powred down with confidence. He that will reflect ſeriouſly upon the paſſages of your diſcourſe, I pointed at in this Chapter, and many others of the like ſort to be ſeen in your Book, will ſee I do you no injury in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I give of your writing, reſolving to take no notice of any I ſhall ſee for the future of this kind, being deſirous to make better uſe of the time God is pleaſed to lend me, then to ſpend it in ſhifting ſuch trifles.</p>
               <p>Here I will add one argument more of this mans weakneſs and peeviſh temper, that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me refuting briefly a reply of <hi>Becan</hi> to an argument I was urging, and not underſtanding the drift of my argument, or wanting an anſwer, he only ſays that he knows not why I mentioned <hi>Becan,</hi> if it be not to let men know that I am acquainted with the Books of great Divines. Such as are acquainted with Scholes and Books of Divinity, do know for what kind of Dïvines the Summary Theology of <hi>Becan</hi> was made, for ſuch as have not time or other requiſits to go deeper. Truly when I take points of Divinity in hand to reſolve upon them, I am not wont
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53284:236"/>reſt upon the <hi>Memorandums</hi> of <hi>Becan.</hi> I allow Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> the glory of being more converſant in this Writer. And indeed I find them ſvmbolize in one thing, which is to put off preſſing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Adverſaries with a flout or ſarcaſm, fitted more to a vulgar applauſe than to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſolid underſtandings. This I obſerved ſometimes in <hi>Becan</hi> (which made me regard him leſs) but very often in Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another proof of the mans truth and talent, is to ſay that all the arguments contained in my diſcourſe are found in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as alſo the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of them, with which I ought to have bin contented without giving him the trouble of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering me. Say you ſo Sr? then the anſwers you return to me, either are of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or of your own making: if of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> your cauſe is deſperate, when your ableſt Champion could produce no better defence of it: if of your own making, you have betrayed your truſt in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the credit of your cauſe upon ſo weak a ground, and not producing the ſoundeſt reaſons that were for it in an occaſion of ſo great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: for certainly he muſt be very blind, that will not ſee by what is ſaid in this Treatiſe, that your anſwers are very weak, impertinent, and often ridiculous.</p>
               <p>But of all this you have an excuſe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of your cauſe. The greateſt wits are too weak to ſupport it. Look upon <hi>Scotus</hi> in 4. diſt. 10. q. 3. ſhivering the arguments of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and others in favor of Tranſubſtantiation, and you will ſee wit and learning triumph in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. Look upon the ſame <hi>Scotus</hi> engaged
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53284:237"/>in defending Tranſubſtantiation, to comply with the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council againſt his own fentiments, as he confeſſes, and you will find him ridiculous, as may appear by what I related of him above, chap. 23. How ſtrong and formal is <hi>Suarez</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Chriſtian verities againſt Infidels, how faint and wavering in the defence of Purgatory, Indulgences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſeen above, chap. 31. Its a complaint grown very common among your party againſt <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that the Arguments he objects againſt the Romiſh Tenets, are ſtronger then his Anſwers to them: and certain I am, it was not for want of wit or will in him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Roman intereſt, it was the condition of the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>You brag of Auſterities uſed by ſome orders of the Roman Church. If this be a rule of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Pagans there be that exceed you in it, afflicting their bodies with deſperate Auſterities even to the deſtruction of ſoul and body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is one of your calumnies to ſay Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſhould condem faſting and corporal affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions diſcreetly uſed and without Hypocriſy, to curb the luſt of the fleſh; ſuch they do commend, and many do practice, tho with leſs oſtentation then is uſed among you.</p>
               <p>You tell me that the Precepts of the Roman Church, without Controverſ do oblige me, and that by every omiſſion of a Holy-day Maſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I commit a hainous ſin. Oh great Divine! I have demonſtrated with reaſons, in my own judgment at leaſt, evidently convincing, that I can not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Precepts of the Roman Church without infringing the Divine, that in many things they
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53284:237"/>are oppoſite. Which of them ſhall I prefer? Is it not ſo, that <hi>we ought to obey God rather then men? Act.</hi> v. 29. You ſpeak of vows I made: but if all was grounded upon a blind obedience to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> including a diſ-obedience to the Laws of God, whereof I am now certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and delivered reaſons of it, which after ſundry oppoſitions and ſtreight ſcrutinies remain ſtill in the ſame force with me, by the common vote of Divines ſuch vows are null, and I am to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally free from obligation of complying with them.</p>
               <p>And finally, whereas you conclude with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to me of returning to your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I will requite you with an Admonition better grounded, of conſidering the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition you are in, dazled with the ſplendor of the Roman Grandeur, and baited with the ſtrong allurements of it, deceiving the world with colours of Sanctity, when Ambition and Avarice is the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and the Soul that animates all your motions. Many ſimple Souls are not aware of the profane ſecular drifts of this great Engine of Religion ſet up by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Italians, to make all the world contribute to their Luſt and Pride, hooking in with ſlight, more then thoſe more honeſt anci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt Romans could win with the ſword. But you and your like, that pretend to learning and knowledg, are in a worſe condition, and we have but too much ground to ſuſpect you are wilfully in an error, and therefore guilty of deceiving the world, and being complices of the deſtruction and miſeries of Chriſtendom, being your ſelf the moſt decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53284:238"/>when your work is to deceive others. This is a matter of greater ſcruple and conſequence, then that you intimate to me of an obligation to hear Maſs on every Holy-day. I commend it therefore to your ſerious conſideration, and to fear and think upon ſeriouſly that wo declared againſt corrupt Teachers, by the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> XXXIV. 2. <hi>&amp;c. Wo be to the ſhepherds of</hi> Iſrael <hi>that do feed themſelves. Should not the ſhepherds feed the flocks? .... with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them; and they were ſcattered becauſe there is no ſhepherd.... Therefore, Oh ye ſhepherds, hear the words of the Lord, thus ſaith the Lord God, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am againſt the ſhepherds, and I will require my flock at their hand, and cauſe them to ceaſe from feeding the flock,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>O how may we fear this will be the end of your Pride and Cruelty! that pretending to have all, you may loſe all; and while you pretend to domineer over all the faithful, you may be trampled under the feet of Infidels. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſet God againſt you it will be ſo, he will cauſe you <hi>ceaſe from feeding the flock,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at your hands the decay of it.</p>
               <p>This is our fear: but our earneſt deſire and hearty praier to God is, that he may be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to clear your minds from the cloud of earthly paſſions, which poſſeſſed of the will, do blind the underſtanding; that he may raiſe your hearts to a real inquiry of Gods honor and ſervice, and inſpire into your leaders thoughts of peace with your Chriſtian Brethren, and not a further affliction to his holy Church.</p>
